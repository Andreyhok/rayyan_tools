# rayyan_tools
These are simple scripts created to automate work with the rayan reaserch tool.
In "kappa.py" one can find functions for the Fleiss's fixed-marginal kappa and the Randolph's free-marginal kappa calculation. Formula used for calculation and other related information can be found on http://justusrandolph.net/kappa/.
In "batches.py" one can find functions for splitting a collection of articles from .ris file into batches. One can choose the number of batches, the number of articles per batch and whether the articles will be randomly assigned to batches or not.
