AB  - Advanced stage symptomatic follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is rarely, if ever, curable with conventional chemotherapy. Patients classically experience a pattern of remission and relapse, eventually dying of their disease. Data from a number of large-scale randomised phase III trials, both as first-line therapy and in relapsed/refractory patients, comparing rituximab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone indicate that the addition of rituximab to a number of different chemotherapy regimens increases response rates and progression-free survival (PFS), without significantly increasing toxicity. Moreover, in four trials, three in first-line and one in relapsed disease, a significant overall survival benefit has been observed for rituximab combination therapy. These data indicate that patients with follicular NHL who require therapy should now receive rituximab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Additionally, a strong case remains for offering rituximab-based therapy to patients with relapsed disease who have not previously received it, and in those who have previously responded well to this agent. Rituximab maintenance therapy has also been shown to significantly prolong PFS after rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease and in newly diagnosed patients who have not received rituximab during induction, and the benefit of maintenance after immunochemotherapy in relapsed patients may yet be mirrored by ongoing studies in the first-line setting. This overview considers the most recently published clinical trials of rituximab and their potential effect on clinical practice in the treatment of follicular NHL.

AB  - Introduction: Readmission is the main reason for failure in an at home-care program and also of patient's dissatisfaction. Neutropenic fever (NF) is the major extrahematological complication in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and a mandatory reason for readmission in most current home-care programs. Material (or patients) and methods: Between November 2000 and November 2015, 211 consecutive patients were managed at-home since day +1 of ASCT conditioned with BEAM, for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n = 136), and with standard dose of Melphalan for MM (n = 75). Antibacterial prophylaxis included levofloxacin 500 mg/d (p.o.) plus ceftriaxone 1 g/d (i.v.) or piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/ 8 h (i.v.). First-line therapy of NF was piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/6 h (i.v.) or refrigerated meropenem 1 g/8 h (i.v.) using a portable intermittent infusion pump for both drugs. Teicoplanin was added if oral mucositis of NCI-CTC-score grade >=2, signs of infection at the catheter insertion, or Gram-positive infection. Amikacin was started if fever persisted more than 3 days or in case of Gram-negative infection. Fever without hemodynamic instability responsive to first-line antibiotics was treated at-home. Only patients with NF and focal infection, persistent fever or signs of severe sepsis were readmitted. Result(s): Median age at transplantation was 48.6 (range, 17 to 69) years. All patients included had a good performance status (ECOG<=2). The quantity of peripheral blood CD34+ cell dose (x106/kg) infused was 3.9 (range, 1.5 to 21). Recovery (days) of granulocyte count above 0.5x109/l was 11 (range, 7 to 26). The global incidence of grades >=2 oral mucositis and gastrointestinal toxicity (NCI-CTC-score) was 21%. Of the 211 patients, 129 (61%) developed NF. Median day of appearance of fever was day +4 (range, day +2 to +13). Patients with fever received intravenous antibiotics for a median of 8 (range, 5 to 16) days, and teicoplanin and/or amikacin was added in 62 (48%) of the 129 febrile episodes. Bacterial infection was documented in 23 (18%) of febrile episodes. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci was the more frequent bacteria isolated (n = 17; 74%). The other infectious agents were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Streptococcus viridans (n = 1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). Of the 129 patients developing NF only 22 (17%) fulfilled criteria for readmission: pneumonia (n = 4), persistent fever (n = 15) and severe sepsis with hemodynamic instability (n = 3) requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit. Therefore, in 107 (83%) patients the NF was managed fully at-home and none of them died, while one (4.5%) of the patients readmitted died, which was due to respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (P=0.17). Readmission rate by NF in MM patients was constant over time (16%), while lymphoma patients autografted since March 2007 experienced a dramatic reduction of readmission rate with the use of piperacillintazobactam as primary antibacterial prophylaxis (15/62 (24%) vs. 1/31 (3%); P=0.02). Conclusion(s): In our home-care experience, NF per se is not a mandatory reason for readmission using simple clinical criteria. Likewise, the use of prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam reduces significantly the need for hospital readmission in lymphoma patients receiving BEAM, optimizing both domiciliary and hospital resources.

AB  - Background CD20 is a cell surface antigen commonly expressed on B-cell lineage, but is absent on hematopoietic stem cells and plasma cells. Therefore, it has been postulated that its targeting should not significantly affect immunoglobulin serum concentrations. However, due to rapid and prolonged B-cell depletion, rituximab-based therapy has been shown to impair humoral response. In addition, protective serologic response to influenza vaccination in lymphoma patients in the 6 months following rituximab-containing regimen has been found to be particularly low1. Because the vast majority of adults individuals have been previously vaccinated against tetanus, we decided to analyse the impact of prolonged rituximab-based therapy on the immune protection rate against tetanus toxin in patients, and conducted in this aim a sub-analysis in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients treated into the PRIMA study Methods The PRIMA study is a multicentre, phase III, randomized study in patients with advanced FL evaluating the benefit of maintenance therapy with rituximab after induction of response with chemotherapy plus rituximab in comparison with no maintenance therapy, whose results have been previously published2. In a subset of patients, serum samples were prospectively collected and antitetanus toxin antibodies were measured at baseline, end of immunochemotherapy induction and end of maintenance period. Protective titer was defined as > 0.1 UI/mL according to standards. Statistical analysis aimed to determine if serum antitetanus antibodies titers significantly changed over time according to different phases of treatment, and if rituximab maintenance arm had a significant impact as compared to observation arm Results Overall, 104 patients were evaluable for this subanalysis. Fifty-five percent were male. Median age was 57 (range, 27-80), 88.5% had Ann-Arbor stage III-IV disease. All patients had received R-CHOP induction. Among those patients, 56 were randomised into rituximab arm, 48 into observation arm. At baseline, median serum antitetanus antibodies titers in the overall population was 0.8 UI/mL (range, 0-8) and 89.4% of patients had protective titers. At the end of induction, among the 70 evaluable subjects, 90% had still a protective titer with a median of 0.7 UI/mL (range, 0-4), and at the end of maintenance period, among the 62 evaluable patients, 93% had still protective titer with a median of 0.8 (range, 0-3). When comparing the two arms, at the end of maintenance period, median serum antitetanus antibodies titer was 0.8 UI/mL in the rituximab arm, not significantly different from that in the observation arm (0.6 UI/mL) (p=0.17). At the end of the maintenance period, 100% of subjects had still protective titer in the rituximab arm versus 84.6% in the observation arm Conclusion In this subanalysis of 104 FL treated patients issued from the PRIMA study, rituximab-based induction and maintenance therapy did not significantly affect the immunisation rate against tetanus toxin in previously immunized patients. These results are in contrast with the poor serologic response rate obtained following rituximab-based therapy, emphasizing that common serum vaccinal titers should be controlled, and vaccination updated, when possible, before treatment initiation and the first rituximab administration.

AB  - To compare toxicity of etoposide bolus with continuous infusion and to assess the efficacy of the CEMP (cisplatinum, etoposide, mitoxantrone, prednisone) regimen, 47 patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma older than 60 years (n = 43) or not qualifying for high-dose chemotherapy (n = 4) received five four-weekly CEMP cycles. Patients were randomised to start with bolus or continuous-infusion etoposide and then received bolus and infusional etoposide in an alternating fashion. The primary objective was the comparison of differences in the course of leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia between the two application schedules. CEMP was well tolerated with little organ and moderate haematotoxicity. There was no difference in toxicity between bolus and continuous-infusion etoposide. Complete remission rate was 44% in patients relapsing >=1 year, 27% in patients relapsing within the first year after achieving complete remission and 5% in primary refractory patients. Median event-free and overall survivals for all patients were 3 and 10 months, respectively. The observed equitoxicity and the more challenging logistics of a 60-h infusion make bolus injection the preferred application of etoposide. As the CEMP regimen is well tolerated and efficacious in elderly patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for whom more aggressive therapies are not feasible, a three-weekly modification of CEMP should be tested in combination with rituximab.

AB  - Peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT) from unrelated donors (n = 37) were compared with bone marrow transplants (BM, bone marrow group, n = 37) in a matched pair analysis. Ten patients (2, class 1) in the alloPBSCT group and seven patients (2, class 1) in the BM group had one HLA locus mismatch donor, respectively. The following factors were matched: HLA-compatibility, diagnosis, disease stage, age and gender. The median age in the PBSC group was 37 years (19-56, excluding one 6-year-old child) and in the BM group 37 years (18-53). The BM group consisted of 12 females and 25 males, 17 females and 20 males were in the PBSC group. Twelve patients in the BM and 11 patients in the PBSC group were diagnosed with AMI,; 7/7, ALL; 15/15, CML; 2/3, MDS; 1/1, NHL. Thirty-four (14/20) of the 74 patients (45%) were considered as high risk patients. The conditioning regimen was BU/CY for standard risk patients with myeloid diseases (31 patients) and TBI/CY for ALL and NHL patients (36 patients); six patients received intensified conditioning with VP16 (2 patients), thiotepa (2 patients) or melphalan (1 patient). The GVHD prophylaxis regimen was used according to the Seattle protocol. DFS was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days, in PBSC and BM transplants, respectively. The median time to leukocyte engraftment in PBSC patients was 14 days (range 6-26 days) and in the BM group 19 days (range 9-29 days; P < 0.02). The time of platelet engraftment did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 40% (four patients died, 13%) in the PBSC group and 20)% (three patients died, 8%) in the BM group, respectively (P < 0.05, log-rank). No signs of aGVHD were found in 19% of the patients in the PBSC and 27% in the BM group. Our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT does lead to a significantly faster leukocyte engraftment. The significant increase with regard to the incidence and shorter time of onset of severe aGVHD in PBSC patients, compared to marrow transplant patients, need to be confirmed in a randomised trial.

AB  - PIX306 was a phase 3, randomised, single-blind, multicentre trial conducted in adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3 who relapsed after >=1 rituximab-containing regimen and were not eligible for a stem cell transplant. Patients were randomised 1:1 to pixantrone 50 mg/m2 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, combined with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, for up to six cycles. Patients were followed for up to 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), complete response (CR) rate, overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Overall, 312 patients were randomised (median age 73.0 years). The study did not meet its primary endpoint. Median PFS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 7.3 months (5.2-8.4) with pixantrone + rituximab (PIX + R) and 6.3 months (4.4-8.1) with gemcitabine + rituximab [GEM + R; hazard ratio (HR): 0.85; 95% CI 0.64-1.14; P = 0.28]. Median OS was 13.3 (10.1-19.8) months with PIX + R and 19.6 (12.4-31.9) months with GEM + R (HR: 1.13; 95% CI 0.83-1.53). ORR was 61.9% and 43.9% respectively and CR rate 35.5% and 21.7%. The incidence of adverse events, including cardiac events, was not statistically significant different between PIX + R and GEM + R.Copyright Â© 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Plerixafor (P) in combination with filgrastim (F) is currently approved for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). F + P is a very expensive but reduces the incidence of mobilization failure. In an effort to utilize P in a cost efficient manner, we employed a risk adaptive strategy of using P only in patients who are at high risk of mobilization failure defined by peripheral blood CD34+ cell (pCD34) count of < 10/muL after 4 days of F alone. In this study we present the results of efficacy and an estimate of cost of such a risk adaptive strategy for autologous peripheral blood HPC collection. 42 patients with history ofNHL orMMundergoing peripheral blood HPCmobilization fromFebruary toDecember 2009 were included in the analysis. All patients received daily filgrastim for 4 days. Our risk adaptive approach was to add P for those 'at-risk' patients, who on day 4 had a pCD34 count of < 10/muL, with apheresis commencing the following morning. Morning administration of F and evening dosing of P was continued daily in this group of 'at-risk' patients for up to amaximumof 4 days or until. > 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were collected. Results of consecutive patients who had peripheral blood HPC mobilization were prospectively collected. A decision analytic model was created to estimate the mean cost and effectiveness rates in patients who underwent mobilization with F versus F + P. 18 patients were mobilized with F alone and 24 patients required F + P. Administration of P was safe and no severe adverse events were recorded. Addition of P increased the pCD34 count by 6.8 fold with an average total yield of 4.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. The frequency of poor mobilization among F only and F + P patients was 25%and 7% respectively. The pooled average cost benefit for mobilization with F + P may be up to $ 16,900 per patient and could potentially increase the annual number of transplants by more than 18%. Following autologous stem cell infusion, days to neutrophil and platelet engraftments were similar between the patients who mobilized HPC with F versus F + P (p = 0.12). These results suggest that addition of P to F based on a risk adaptive strategy significantly reduces the frequency of mobilization failures and is also cost effective. Addition of P to F forHPC mobilization has no significant impact on the neutrophil and platelet engraftment.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) dissemination of aggressive lymphoma is a rare and aggressive disorder which may present de novo with concomitant systemic disease or as CNS relapse (isolated or with systemic disease). The majority of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be cured with R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). The most common cause of treatment failure is systemic relapse or progression. However, CNS relapse occurs in 2-6% of all DLBCL patients and is associated with a poor survival of less than six months. Modern risk stratification includes several clinical and biological features. A validated clinical risk model employing the International Prognostic Index risk factors plus adrenal or renal involvement is able to identify a high-risk patient population with an increased risk for CNS recurrence > 10%. Nevertheless, there is little data to inform optimal delivery of CNS prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Recently, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) has increasingly been used in routine clinical practice due to the limited efficacy of intrathecal prophylaxis and the predominant parenchymal site of CNS manifestation. However, this approach is not supported by randomized data. Indication, timing and intensity of HD-MTX delivery differs largely and its efficacy has recently been challenged by results of a large Canadian retrospective study including > 900 patients showing that HD-MTX did not lower the risk of CNS dissemination in DLBCL. Once CNS dissemination has occurred, intensive CNS directed therapy appears to improve overall outcomes compared to systemic therapy alone. Recent data from the largest prospective trial focused on SCNSL patients support this approach by demonstrating durable remission after intensified chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab, cytarabine, thiotepa and rituximab (MATRix) and the non-cross resistant agents ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide with rituximab (R-ICE) followed by thiotepa-based highdose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Importantly, patients with CNS disease at initial diagnosis and patients with CNS dissemination during or after upfront R-CHOP treatment showed different outcomes. This presentation will highlight recent evidence regarding prophylaxis and treatment of CNS involvement of aggressive lymphoma and derive treatment approaches for this heterogeneous subgroup of patients.

AB  - Objectives: Assess the effects of rituximab on salivary gland (SG) histopathology and systemically on the Tâcell compartment in the Trial for AntiâBâCell Therapy in patients with primary SjÃ¶grenâs Syndrome (TRACTISS) cohort. Methods: 26 subjects randomised to rituximab or placebo consented for SG biopsy at baseline, weeks 16 and 48. Biopsies were fluorescently assessed for Bâcells (CD20+), Tâcells (CD3+), follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (CD21+) and plasma cells (CD138+). Digital imaging analysis and semiâquantitative grading quantified SG inflammation. RNA extracted from matched SGs underwent sequencing and gene signatureâbased analysis (xCell) to infer 64 immune cell types. Matched sera were assessed for Tâhelper cytokines and Bâlymphocyte chemoattractant (CXCL13) using LEGENDplexTM and ELISA immunoassays, respectively. Results: Two cycles of rituximab prevented new Bâcell infiltration, development of FDC networks within SG inflammatory aggregates and ectopic GC organisation at 48 weeks. Gene enrichment analysis (xCell) demonstrated a prevention of classâswitchedâ and memory Bâcell infiltration by rituximab, with no effect on Tâcells or plasma cells. The reduction of ELS organisation was confirmed by transcriptomic analysis showing a downregulation of lymphocyte recruitment and ectopic GC organisation genes, such as CXCL13, CCR7, CCL19 and LTÎ². The analysis of placebo SGs transcriptomics at week 48 showed a higher expression of ectopic GC organisation genes in females compared to male subjects, suggesting a genderâdriven difference in SG inflammation progression. Peripheral markers of salivary gland inflammation and SG GC organisation, such as CXCL13, were reduced after rituximab, together with Tâcell cytokines IFNâg, ILâ4, ILâ17F, ILâ21, known to be involved in ectopic lymphomagenesis. Conclusions: Rituximab preserves residual SG function by preventing worsening SG inflammation and ELS formation compared to placebo, by affecting FDC network development and downregulating genes involved in Bâcell migration and organisation. These results reflect the clinical improvement of unstimulated whole salivary flow observed at week 48 in rituximabâtreated patients in the TRACTISS trial.

AB  - Nutrition assessment and management of a patient with cancer is complicated by physiologic abnormalities associated with the tumor, adverse effects of cancer treatment, and weight changes that may occur before, during, and/or after treatment. Food intolerances and alterations in metabolism and hypercatabolism affect timely administration of nutrition support. In older patients, it is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, frailty, and cognitive concerns. Few evidence-based guidelines exist to direct nutritional care and evaluation of nutrition outcomes in patients with cancer. A case study of an elderly patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is reviewed, with emphasis on available evidence-based nutrition prevention and support recommendations.

AB  - Introduction: The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens enabled successful HCT in patients above 60 years. However, the impact of age on outcome in patients >60 years has not been evaluated extensively. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 104 consecutive patients (f=53, m=61) aged >60 who received allogeneic HCT 2000-2010 at our institution. Median age of the patients was 65 years (range, 61-76). Patients were grouped in two cohorts: group 1 aged 60-65 years (n=59, median age=63) and group 2 aged 66-76 years (n=45, median age=68). Diagnoses were acute leukemia (AML=63, ALL=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=13), osteomyelofibrosis (n=7), Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (n=7), multiple myeloma (n=8), aplastic anemia (n=1), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=2) and chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=2). At time of HCT 39 of the patients were in complete remission (CR), 65 in partial remission (PR). Conditioning regimens were grouped in high (TBI/Bu+Cy, n=5), intermediate (FLAMSA, Flu/Mel/BCNU, n=27), low (FLU+alkylans, n=44) and minimal (2GyTBI/Flu, n=28) intensity. Intermediate intensity conditioning was particularly used for high risk patients in PR (24/27 patients). 20 patients were transplanted from matched related (MRD), 45 from matched unrelated (MUD) and 39 from mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD). Result(s): Kaplan-Meier-estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) was 44% with a non-significant advantage for patients in CR vs. PR (51 vs. 40%, p=0.25). Non-relapse-mortality was 32%. The outcomes with intermediate, low and minimal intensity conditioning were comparable (3-year OS 50% vs. 47% vs. 46%) while all patients after high intensity conditioning died. HCT from MRD had an inferior OS compared to MUD or MMUD (3-year-OS 0% vs. 42 and 36% respectively for group 1, 33% vs. 73 and 65% respectively for group 2, not significant). Incidences of acute GVHD >=II, limited and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 12, 23 and 13%, respectively. Acute GVHD >=II was associated with inferior outcome (3-year OS of 18 vs. 41%, p=0.004). 3-year OS for group 1 and 2 were 30 and 67%, respectively (p=0.02). Patients in group 2 had a better outcome with low and minimal intensity vs. intermediate conditioning (3-year OS 84 and 70% vs. 51%, not significant). Conclusion(s): Age has no major impact on outcome of allogeneic HCT. Patient aged >60 seem to benefit from the use of MUD rather than an older MRD. The regimen used should be tailored to disease risk and patient performance status.

AB  - The prognostic role of TP53 disruption has been established in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Aim of this analysis was to correlate TP53 mutations by Sanger sequencing, cell of origin (COO) profile by Lymph2Cx panel on the NanoString platform and MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 overexpression or re-arrangements by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), with outcome in DLBCL patients enrolled into the FIL-DLCL04 trial (NCT00499018). One hundred and twenty-five DLBCL patients with tumour block available were analyzed. TP53 was mutated in 11/125 (9%) cases; 60/125 patients received high-dose chemoimmunotherapy up-front, as for the randomization arm; COO was reported in 88 patients: 48 germinal centre B-cell like, 25 activated B-cell like and 17 unclassified; 26 patients were double expressors in IHC and 11 double hit in FISH. After a median follow-up of 72âmonths, five-year failure-free survival (FFS) for TP53 mutated versus wild-type was 24% and 72%, and five-year overall survival (OS) was 34% and 83%, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 2Â·28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0Â·89-5Â·86, pâ=â0Â·086] and 4Â·05 (95% CI 1Â·37-11Â·97, pâ=â0Â·011) for FFS and OS, respectively. In this series of young DLBCL patients, TP53 gene mutation identified a poor prognosis subgroup, regardless of treatment and other biological markers.

AB  - Personalized medicine aims to match the right drug with the right patient by using specific features of the individual patient's tumor. However, current strategies of personalized therapy matching provide treatment opportunities for less than 10% of patients with cancer. A promising method may be drug profiling of patient biopsy specimens with single-cell resolution to directly quantify drug effects. We prospectively tested an image-based single-cell functional precision medicine (scFPM) approach to guide treatments in 143 patients with advanced aggressive hematologic cancers. Fifty-six patients (39%) were treated according to scFPM results. At a median follow-up of 23.9 months, 30 patients (54%) demonstrated a clinical benefit of more than 1.3-fold enhanced progression-free survival compared with their previous therapy. Twelve patients (40% of responders) experienced exceptional responses lasting three times longer than expected for their respective disease. We conclude that therapy matching by scFPM is clinically feasible and effective in advanced aggressive hematologic cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first precision medicine trial using a functional assay to instruct n-of-one therapies in oncology. It illustrates that for patients lacking standard therapies, high-content assaybased scFPM can have a significant value in clinical therapy guidance based on functional dependencies of each patient's cancer.Copyright Â©2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - To circumvent aGVHD in the early phase after allogeneic stem cell transplantation but to provide GVL activity later on, we performed alloPBSCT with CD34+ selected grafts followed by delayed add-back of CD3+ T cells. Ten consecutive patients having an HLA-identical sibling donor were enrolled on to this trial. Four patients were in first CR of high-risk ALL, another four in first CR of AML, one was in second myeloid blast crisis of CML, and one was in PR of relapsed NHL. Conditioning consisted of 2 x 60 mg/kg CY plus 12 Gy TBI. G-CSF (Filgrastim) mobilized peripheral cells were CD34+ selected using the Isolex 300i system in nine patients and the CliniMacs system in one. Median CD34+ purity was 86%. A median of 2.8 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells were transplanted. The number of CD3+ cells in the allografts was 5.7 x 10(4)/kg (median) after Isolex 300i, and 0.2 x 10(4)/kg after CliniMacs. All patients received G-CSF (Filgrastim) and engrafted rapidly. Standard-dose CsA was administered, and until day +60 no aGVHD occurred. At that time point, seven patients received 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells while CsA had been tapered to 50% of the starting dose. One of these patients died after a second T cell boost given on day +90 without concomitant immunosuppression due to grade IV intestinal aGVHD. Three others developed cutaneous cGVHD. Taken together, T cell depletion by CD34+ selection does not impair rapid engraftment in the HLA-identical sibling donor setting. Using standard-dose CsA the risk for acute GVHD seems to be minimized. Add-back of 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells on day +60 with CsA protection is feasible. However, whether this is the optimal time point and number of T cells remain to be further elucidated.

AB  - Optimum treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma remains challenging because there have not been any large randomised clinical trials of this rare tumour. Drugs used in treating systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma have mostly proven ineffective because of difficulties crossing the blood-brain barrier. The recognition of the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate was a substantial therapeutic breakthrough and further advances, such as the development of polychemotherapy regimens, have built on this. Whole-brain radiotherapy can consolidate response to chemotherapy, but the associated toxic effects of chemoradiation can be unacceptable. Other effective approaches include disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the use of high-dose chemotherapy. Recently, there have been attempts to optimise multi-drug chemotherapy regimens by focusing on improving survival and reducing toxic effects. A promising area of research is the incorporation of novel targeted drugs into standard treatment frameworks. In the future, greater cooperation between research groups should hopefully lead to further therapeutic advances.

AB  - Study question: This study aims to analyze alterations in proteomic profiles and validate selected protein biomarkers of spermatozoa in men with history of undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Summary answer: Cancer-associated protein was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis and database searching. And the protein was validated by Western-blotting. What is known already: As advanced cancer treatments have improved the prognosis of cancer survivors, these treatments such as chemotherapy have been known to cause harmful effect on fertile capacity. A few studies reported the alternation in proteins of spermatozoa between cancer patients and healthy donor and some proteins with different expression levels were identified between two groups. Study design, size, duration: This research is a cross-sectional cell-line research of control versus treatment. A group of patients with a history of anticancer drug administration in cancer diagnosis was assigned as 'cancer group'(n=3), and a fertile donor group was assigned as 'control group'(n=3). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and this study design was approved by institutional review board of Yokohama City University Medical Center. Participants/materials, setting, methods: The original diseases of cancer group were non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma(n=2) and soft tissue tumor(n=1). Measuring the total sperm count by CASA, they were adjusted to 6 million in all specimens, and protein concentration was adjusted by BCA assay. After trypsin digestion and desalting, the expressed proteins in spermatozoa were analyzed by LQ-MS/MS and database searching was performed in two groups. Validation was performed for the proteins with different expression levels by Western-blotting. Main results and the role of chance: A total of 1,152 proteins and 5,268 peptides were identified by global proteomics in both groups. Sorted by max fold change of expressions (>5 folds) and ANOVA (p<0.01), 29 proteins were identified. Of these identified proteins, we focused on one protein, which is cancer-associated protein highly expressed in digestive tract and urinary tract. In sperm of patients with cancer, this protein was overexpressed 54.8-folds more than that of fertile donor. This protein co-works with other protein of T-cell proliferation factor. Regimens of cancer chemotherapy patients in cancer group received were ABVD and IFM, ADM, and VCM therapy, respectively.By the Western-blotting, expression of this protein was validated. Limitations, reasons for caution: Limitations of this research was inability to compare the sperm before and after the administration of cancer chemotherapy, because spermatozoa were all cryopreserved for fertility preservation before treatment. Wider implications of the findings: It was speculated that T cell proliferation was induced by interaction between these proteins after induction of cancer chemotherapy. Functional analysis of these proteins would provide clue to the mechanisms of impaired spermatogenesis after cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - Background: Fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab is frequently used in patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas who relapse after alkylating chemotherapy. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rituximab with bendamustine or fludarabine in patients with relapsed, indolent, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mantle-cell lymphoma. Method(s): For this randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 55 centres in Germany, who were subsequently randomised centrally according to prespecified randomisation lists with permuted blocks of randomly variable block size to rituximab (375 mg/m2, day 1) plus either bendamustine (90 mg/m2, days 1 and 2) or fludarabine (25 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 28 days for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Patients were aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 0-2 and had relapsed or refractory indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma; patients refractory to regimens that included rituximab, bendamustine, or purine analogue drugs were excluded. Patients were stratified by histological subtypes of lymphoma and by their latest previous therapies. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and the final analysis was completed per protocol. Non-inferiority of bendamustine plus rituximab versus fludarabine plus rituximab was defined as a difference of less than 15% in 1-year progression-free survival. The protocol was amended in July, 2006, after approval of rituximab maintenance (375 mg/m2 every 3 months for up to 2 years), which was then given to patients achieving a response to either trial treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01456351 (closed to enrolment, follow-up is ongoing). Finding(s): Between Oct 8, 2003, and Aug 5, 2010, we randomly assigned 230 patients to treatment groups (116 bendamustine plus rituximab, 114 fludarabine plus rituximab). 11 patients were excluded for protocol violations and were not followed up further (two in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and nine in the fludarabine plus rituximab group). Thus, 219 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis (114 bendamustine plus rituximab, 105 fludarabine plus rituximab). 1-year progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.84) and 0.48 (0.39-0.58) with fludarabine plus rituximab (non-inferiority p<0.0001). At a median follow-up of 96 months (IQR 73.2-112.9), median progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 34.2 months (95% CI 23.5-52.7) and 11.7 months (8.0-16.1) with fludarabine plus rituximab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54 [95% CI 0.38-0.72], log-rank test p<0.0001). Safety outcomes were similar in both groups, with 46 serious adverse events recorded (23 in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and 23 in the fludarabine plus rituximab group), most commonly myelosuppression and infections. Interpretation(s): In combination with rituximab, bendamustine was more effective than fludarabine, suggesting that bendamustine plus rituximab may be the preferred treatment option for patients with relapsed indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas.

AB  - Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are frequently used following haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with a high risk of relapse. Limited data are available on the characteristics of GVHD in this setting. The aim of this study is to investigate the NIH type, severity, treatment and response rates of GVHD following DLI. Consecutive patients receiving DLI at 4 transplantation centres in the UK were identified since 2006. Data were collected retrospectively to include diagnosis, date of transplant, dates and doses of DLI, onset of GVHD, treatment of GVHD, follow up (FU) and outcome. 58 patients were identified having received DLI. The mean age at HSCT was 55yrs (median 45, range 20-70). Haematological malignancies were AML in 22, MDS in 9, CML in 7, myeloma in 5, CLL in 5, NHL in 3 and other in 7. 33 received matched related and 25 unrelated donor transplants. The reason cited for DLI was pre-emptive (mixed chimerism) in 30, therapeutic in 28 (relapse in 18, molecular relapse in 6, cytogenetic abnormality in 3 and consolidation in 1). DLI was given at a mean of 14 months after HSCT (median 7, range 1-65). DLI dose ranged from 1x105-1x107 CD3+ cellskg-1. The number of doses ranged from 1-8, mean 2.3, median 2. 43 patients had GVHD after DLI (acute in 16, chronic in 26 and overlap in1). In aGVHD skin was the most common organ involved in 13/16 patients, followed by liver in 7, and gut in 6. 9/16 had single organ involvement (7 skin only, 2 liver only). 3 patients had skin and gut and 4 skin, gut and liver. In 6 patients this was severe (grade III-IV aGVHD). Of the 27 with cGVHD the most common organ involved in decreasing order was skin (n=20), oral (n=16), liver (n=9), eye (n=6), gut (n=4) and lung (n=1). 9 patients had single organ involvement (skin only in 6, oral 2, eye 1). 12 patients had 2, 2 had 3, 2 had 4 and 2 had five organs involved. 8 patients had cGVHD recorded as severe. The mean time between first DLI doses and development of aGVHD was 2 months (median 1, range 1-5 months) and 5.7months (median 3, range 1-28) in cGVHD. First treatment of aGVHD was oral prednisolone in all 16 patients: first treatment response was CR in 4/16, relapse in 4 and progressive GVHD in 8. 5 died (2 from relapse, 2 from aGVHD and 1 from pneumonia). 5 with progressive GVHD received a 2nd line therapy (ECP in 3, tacrolimus in 1 & MMF in 1). 2 patients had a CR, 1 patient relapsed and died, 1 has ongoing mild GVHD and the other had 3rd line therapy with ECP and a PR. The 1st treatment in cGVHD was oral prednisolone in 16/27 (prednisolone alone in 12, plus CyA in 2, tacrolimus in 1, MMF in 1). 9 received topical steroids only, 1 received MMF and 1 rituximab. 16/27 patients had a CR to first line therapy, 1 died of severe lung GVHD and 1 relapsed. 9 received a 2nd line therapy (ECP in 4, MMF in 3, imatinib in 1 and infliximab in 1). 1 had CR, 7 had PR and 1 relapsed. 4 had a 3rd line therapy (ECP in 2 and MMF in 2) of which 1 had CR and 3 PR. I further patient had a 4th therapy with ECP and a PR. Of 8 patients with severe cGVHD 1 had 1 therapy (and died), 4 had 2, 2 had 3 and 1 had 4 therapies: 7/8 are alive, 4 in remission with GVHD, 2 in remission without GVHD and 1 relapsed. Mean FU for cohort is 51.7 months (median 45, range 5-124) post HSCT. 35 are in remission, 11 of whom are receiving treatment for GVHD (4 with severe cGVHD). 18 patients relapsed (7 are receiving treatment and 11 died). In total 16/58 died and causes were relapse (11), severe GVHD (3, 2x aGVHD,1x cGVHD), ruptured aortic aneurysm (1) and pneumonia (1). 7/30 (23%) patients receiving DLI for mixed chimerism died compared to 9/18 (50%) receiving DLI for relapse. Overall survival in those developing aGVHD and cGVHD was 63% and 74% respectively compared to 12/15 (80%) in those without GVHD. Death from relapse was similar in those with and without GVHD post DLI at 20% and 26% respectively and death rates in those with severe GVHD do not appear higher. We report on 58 patients receiving DLI after HSCT. 74% developed GVHD which was severe in 24%. In the majority of patients developing GVHD after DLI successful treatment may be achieved with increased immunosuppression. 39% of patients received second line therapy for GVHD most commonly ECP. 21% received a third line therapy. 16/58 patients have died (28%) including 3 (5%) of GVHD. The most common cause of death was relapse in 19%. In summary patients develop both aGVHD and cGVHD post DLI and may require consecutive therapies but mortality from GVHD is infrequent.
