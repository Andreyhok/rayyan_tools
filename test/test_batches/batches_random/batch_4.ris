AB  - Intensive cytotoxic therapy with bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) allows a potential cure for haematological malignancies. Protective strategies to minimise haematological toxicities have been successful and currently toxicity to the gastro-intestinal tract is the major cause of treatment-related morbidity and the dose-limiting factor that prevents further dose escalation. In a randomised, placebo-controlled trial we investigated whether an oral immunoglobulin preparation (IgA-IgG) can diminish intestinal toxicity with autologous BMT. IgA-IgG (n = 6) and placebo (n = 7) were orally administered from 1 day prior to the start until 1 week after the termination of the cytotoxic treatment (a total of 14 days). Intestinal toxicity was assessed by a 51Cr-EDTA absorption test for intestinal permeability and by the clinical criteria laid down by the WHO for the period before the start of the cytotoxic treatment, 1 day prior to stem-cell infusion and 4, 7, 10 and 14 days after stem-cell infusion. In the placebo group there was a significant increase in intestinal permeability on day 4 (P < 0.005) and on day 7 (P < 0.05) after stem-cell infusion, compared with the baseline, which was not seen for IgA-IgG. In addition, patients receiving IgA-IgG had significantly less intestinal permeability on day 4 (P < 0.05) and on day 7 (P < 0.05), compared with the placebo group. No significant, positive effect as regards clinical toxicity was observed. Oral administration of IgA-IgG to patients undergoing intensive cytotoxic therapy prior to BMT seems to have a protective effect on the gut mucosa barrier which is normally disrupted by this therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with peripheral-blood progenitor cell (PBPC) and autologous bone marrow (ABM) transplant (T) has documented survival benefits for relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Treatment costs associated with HDC and its supportive care have restricted its use both on and off clinical trial. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT resulted in faster recovery of bone marrow function, with less hospitalization and supportive care than ABMT. This study was undertaken to analyze the costs of the two strategies using prospectively collected data from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical results and resource utilization from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT following carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) HDC for HD and NHL are presented. The trial was performed in six centers in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Resource utilization data were used to project costs and Massay Cancer Center (MCC) in the United States incurred the cost of treating the cohort. Costs were projected to the United States, because the economic implications to United States centers are significant, costs of care vary markedly among countries but resource utilization on this trial did not, and a randomized trial is unlikely to be performed in the United States. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients with relapsed HD or NHL underwent HDC with BEAM. The PBPCT and ABMT groups had similar short-term survival after BEAM. PBPCT patients had a shorter hospitalization (median, 17 v 23 days; P = .002), neutrophil recovery (11 v 14 days; P = .005), platelet recovery to > or = 20 x 10(9)/L (16 v 23 days; P = .02), and days of platelet transfusions (6 v 10; P < .001). Estimated costs were $8,531 for ABM harvest and $5,760 for PBPC collection, including filgrastim mobilization. The total estimated average cost was $59,314 for each ABMT patient versus $45,792 for each PBPCT patient. Cost savings of $13,521 (23%) were due to shorter hospitalizations with less supportive care. CONCLUSION: PBPCT is as safe and more effective than ABMT for HD and NHL in the short term. PBPCT represents a significant cost savings due to lower autograft collection costs, shorter hospital stays, and less supportive care. The savings exceed the costs for filgrastim mobilization and PBPC collection. Actual savings will vary depending on local practice patterns, charges, and costs.

AB  - Background: Chemotherapy, radiation and autologous bone marrow transplant are conventional standard therapies in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Nowadays the introduction of monoclonal antibodies has enhanced the specificity of treatment, reducing the toxicity and presenting synergism with conventional chemotherapy. Purpose(s): To compare rituximab efficacy and safety in combination with CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone) in the treatment of NHL in our hospital, with that published in the literature. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective observational study of 116 patients diagnosed with NHL who received chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab-CHOP) between January 2005 and December 2010. The authors reviewed the medical history (100%) and the data were analysed using SPSS predictive analytics software. Were recorded: demographic data (age, sex); efficacy (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), overall response rate (ORR), progression and relapse, overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS)); toxicity (haematological and non-haematological). Result(s): 53.5% of patients were male and mean age at diagnosis was 59 years. The authors obtained an ORR of 80.2% (71.3% CR and 8.9% PR). 14.8% of patients did not respond, and 5% had an unknown response. The progression and relapse rates were 18.8% and 17.8% respectively. Projected median OS for responding patients was over 30 months and EFS after one year was 70.3%. Neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia rates were reported as 15.8%, 12.4% and 2.3% respectively. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 1.95% of patients, 72.2% during the first session. The detected rate of infection was relatively low, and 3.5% of all infections were microbiologically documented. Conclusions The results obtained were comparable to those of published studies in the literature for the treatment arm with R-CHOP in randomised patients (GELA NHL-95.5 study group, U.S. Intergroup Study, Mabthera International Trial MINT study). Neutropenia rates were higher than those found in the study of McLaughlin et al, while the other cell lines the results were similar.

AB  - Introduction: Despite frequent long lasting remissions to first-line treatment, follicular lymphoma of advanced stages is characterized by recurrent relapses. In the randomized PRIMA trial of the GELA, rituximab maintenance achieved prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation in remission after first-line immunochemotherapy (Salles et al., Lancet 2011). The German study groups GLSG and OSHO initiated in 2007 a double randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance versus observation in remission after randomly assigned induction treatment. Method(s): Previously untreated patients with Ann Arbor stage II-IV follicular lymphoma in need of therapy and not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation or curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP, R-MCP, or RFCM. Patients responding to induction treatment were subsequently randomised to 2 years rituximab maintenance or observation, stratified by type of induction treatment, quality of remission, and FLIPI. The trial was initially planned to detect with 95% power a 15% difference in complete remission rates between any of the three induction groups and a PFS hazard ratio of 0.60 by postremission strategy. Result(s): Recruitment was stopped in 2011 after the PRIMA results had been published. Median age of the 206 recruited patients was 66 years (range, 24-86), and FLIPI was low in 13%, intermediate in 28%, and high in 60%. A trend towards higher complete remission rates with R-FCM (43% of 58 patients) compared to R-CHOP (23% of 66) and R-MCP (24% of 66) was observed, but the differences were not statistically significant. High and comparable overall response rates were observed after R-CHOP (88%), R-MCP (89%), and R-FCM (91%). In terms of grade 3-4 leukocytopenia and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, R-FCM (92%, 17%) was more toxic than R-MCP (88%, 6%) which was more toxic than R-CHOP (63%, 3%); R-CHOP showed more frequent neurological toxicities (40%) compared with R-MCP (14%) and R-FCM (16%). Rituximab maintenance substantially prolonged progression-free survival in comparison to observation in remission (hazard ratio 0.39, p = 0.0064). In the rituximab maintenance group, 3-years PFS was 89% (8 PFS events among 65 patients) compared with 69% in the observation group (19 events among 63 patients). With 11 events, no differences in overall survival could be observed for maintenance vs. observation (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.32-3.43, p = 0.95). Rituximab maintenance was more toxic with regards to leukocytes and the gastro-intestinal tract. Conclusion(s): In this randomized trial, 2 years rituximab maintenance was associated with substantially prolonged PFS in comparison to observation after response to first-line immunochemotherapy in follicular lymphoma. Our data represent an independent confirmation of the GELA PRIMA trial results.

AB  - Background. The ability of allogeneic transplants performed using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen to deliver long term disease free survival is dependent on the genesis of an immunologically mediated graft-versus tumor (GVT) effect. Post-transplant immunosuppression plays an important role in limiting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) but also modulates a GVT effect. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the most commonly utilised form of GVHD prophylaxis after a RIC allograft but its impact on transplant outcome has not been studied. Aim. We wished to examine the impact of CsA dose intensity on disease relapse and overall survival (OS) in patients transplanted using an alemtuzumab based RIC regimen. Methods. CsA exposure in the first 21 days posttransplant was measured in 132 patients and correlated with overall survival, and relapse risk. 68 patients were transplanted for a myeloid malignancy (acute myeloid leukemia (n=41), myelodysplasia (n=17)) and 74 for a lymphoid malignancy (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=51) or Hodgkin's disease (n=23)). All patients with a myeloid malignancy were transplanted using a regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan and alemtuzumab (FMA). Patients with an underlying lymphoid disease were transplanted using FMA (n=31) or a regimen consisting of BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, melphalan and alemtuzumab (BEAMA) (n=43). 39 patients had chemoresistant disease at the time of transplant. All patients received intravenous CsA at a loading dose of 5 mg/kg on day -1 followed by 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. Patients were switched to oral CsA prior to discharge. Trough CsA levels were measured thrice weekly for the first three weeks after stem cell infusion and the dose of CsA adjusted to achieve levels in the region of 200-300 mug/L during this period. Trough levels obtained during the first 21 days post-transplant were used to calculate the CsA area under the curve (AUC) for each patient. Results. 71 patients were transplanted from HLA identical siblings and 61 from volunteer unrelated donors. The median age of the whole group was 48 years (range 17-68). The incidence of acute GVHD (Grades 2-4) was 34%. The median CsA AUC in the first 21 days post-transplant was 3682 microg.hr/l (range 2162-8084). In univariate analysis the presence of chemoresistant disease at the time of transplant and a high CsA AUC were both associated with a decreased OS. In multivariate analyses chemoresistant disease (HR=2.60, 95% CI 1.44-4.65, p=0.002) and linearly increasing CsA AUC were associated with an increased hazard of death (HR=1.1, 95%CI 1.02-1.24, p=0.02). The two year OS for patients with a CsA AUC less than 3682 microg.hr/l was 77% compared to 30% for patients with CsA greater than 3682 microg.hr/l (p<0.0001). Increased CsA AUC and the presence of chemorefractory disease at the time of transplant were associated with an increased risk of relapse in univariate analysis. In multivariate analyses only increased CsA AUC was significantly associated with a higher risk of relapse (OR=4.1, 95% CI 2.50-6.81, p<0.0001). Decreased CsA AUC and the use of an unrelated donor were associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD in univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the use of an unrelated donor (HR=2.9, 9%% CI 1.36-6.36, p=0.006) and linearly decreasing CsA AUC were significantly associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD (HR=1.2, 95% CI 1.05-1.43, p=0.01). Conclusions. These data identify CsA exposure as a critical and manipulable determinant of outcome after a T depleted RIC allograft. They support a randomised trial aimed at identifying the optimal CsA dose schedule in this population of patients. It will be important to determine whether post-transplant CsA exposure plays a similar role in determining outcome after a T replete RIC allograft.

AB  - Background: Follicular lymphoma is the most common form of lymphoma in Europe and the USA. In this prospective, single-arm, open-labelled, multicentre non-randomised phase II trial (FLUMIZ [FLUdarabine, MItoxantrone, Zevalin] trial) we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fludarabine and mitoxantrone plus radioimmunotherapy in untreated patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Method(s): Patients with stage III or IV untreated indolent follicular NHL were enrolled between June 1, 2004, and April 15, 2006, at 13 Italian institutions, and were treated with oral fludarabine (40 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) and intravenous mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 on day 1) every 28 days for six cycles. Patients who had at least a partial response (PR) with normal platelet counts (>100x109/L) and granulocyte counts (1.5x109/L), and bone-marrow infiltration less than 25% 4-6 weeks after completion of the sixth cycle of chemotherapy were deemed eligible for consolidation treatment 6-10 weeks after the sixth cycle with one course of yttrium-90 (90Y)-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which consisted of an initial infusion of intravenous rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 followed by a second 250 mg/m2 infusion on day 7, 8, or 9. The second infusion was followed by a weight-based dose of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, administered as a slow intravenous push over 10 min. Primary endpoints were complete response (CR) and haematological toxic effects and secondary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. Responses were classified according to the International Workshop for Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered as a European Standard Controlled Trial on the EudraCT website http://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it, number 2004-002211-92. Finding(s): 61 patients were enrolled in the trial and received six cycles of fludarabine and mitoxantrone, after which an overall response was noted in 98% (60 of 61) of patients (43 of 61 patients had CR and 17 of 61 patients had PR). 57 patients (43 with CR and 14 with PR) were deemed eligible for subsequent 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. Of the 14 patients who had PR after the initial treatment, 12 obtained CR after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. By the end of the entire treatment regimen 55 of 57 patients achieved CR. With a median follow-up of 30 months (range 21-48), 3-year progression-free survival was estimated to be 76% (95% CI 72.3-82.4) and 3-year overall survival 100%. 36 of 57 patients had grade 3 or 4 haematological toxic effects, and blood transfusions were given to 21 of 57 patients. Interpretation(s): This trial has provided evidence for the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of fludarabine and mitoxantrone plus 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in untreated patients with follicular NHL.

AB  - Background: Standard treatment for untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is rituximab plus chemotherapy. The incidence of histological transformation of follicular lymphoma has been reported only in heterogeneously treated populations and rarely with long-term follow-up. Additionally, the incidence of secondary malignancies after treatment, without high-dose therapy for follicular lymphoma, is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to assess progression-free survival, overall survival, incidence of secondary malignancies, and incidence of histological transformation in a 10-year follow-up analysis of the JCOG0203 trial. Method(s): In the phase 2-3 randomised JCOG0203 trial, previously untreated patients with stage III or IV indolent B-cell lymphoma, including grades 1-3 follicular lymphoma, from 44 hospital centres in Japan, were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a minimisation method to receive six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab [375 mg/m2], given on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m2], doxorubicin [50 mg/m2], vincristine [1.4 mg/m2, capped at 2.0 mg] given intravenously on day 3, and oral prednisone [100 mg once daily on days 3-7]) every 3 weeks (R-CHOP-21) or every 2 weeks (enabled by mandatory granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration once daily for 6 days, starting on day 8; R-CHOP-14) without rituximab maintenance. Age, bulky disease (nodal or extranodal mass >=10 cm in diameter on CT), and institution were used as adjustment factors. Investigators enrolled participants, and assignment to trial groups was done with a computer-assisted randomisation allocation sequence that took place centrally at the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center, without the intervention of investigators. Interventions were not masked for patients or investigators. Data were collected 10 years after enrolment of the last patient. The primary endpoint of the phase 3 part of the study was progression-free survival, and the primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response. Accrual was 4.5 years, and follow-up was 3 years after registration was closed. Data were updated on the cutoff date of Feb 28, 2017. Intention-to-treat analyses (ie, progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of secondary malignancies) were predefined, to be done at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. An additional analysis of the incidence of histological transformation was defined 15 years after the protocol, on May 8, 2017, in a supplementary analysis plan, and assessed at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. Follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00147121. Finding(s): Between Sept 1, 2002, and Feb 28, 2007, 300 patients were enrolled, and 149 (50%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-21 group and 151 (50%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-14 group. After eligibility was assessed, one patient was excluded from the R-CHOP-21 group. 10-year progression-free survival was not different between groups (R-CHOP-21 33%, 95% CI 25-41; R-CHOP-14 39%, 31-47; hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.67-1.17). In 248 patients with grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma, progression-free survival was 39% (33-45) at 8 years and 36% (30-42) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of histological transformation was 3.2% (95% CI 1.5-6.0) at 5 years, 8.5% (5.4-12.4) at 8 years, and 9.3% (6.1-13.4) at 10 years after enrolment. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies was 8.1% (5.1-12.0) and the cumulative incidence of haematological secondary malignancies was 2.9% (1.3-5.5). Interpretation(s): R-CHOP is a viable option for first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced follicular lymphoma. Clinicians choosing a first-line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma should be cautious of secondary malignancies caused by immunochemotherapy and severe complications of infectious diseases in the long-term follow-up-both of which could lead to death.

AB  - Background: Benefits of cord blood transplantation include low rates of relapse and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the use of cord blood is rapidly declining because of the high incidence of infections, severe acute GVHD, and transplant-related mortality. UM171, a haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal agonist, has been shown to expand cord blood stem cells and enhance multilineage blood cell reconstitution in mice. We aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation in patients with haematological malignancies who do not have a suitable HLA-matched donor. Method(s): This single-arm, open-label, phase 1-2 safety and feasibility study was done at two hospitals in Canada. The study had two parts. In part 1, patients received two cord blood units (one expanded with UM171 and one unmanipulated cord blood) until UM171-expanded cord blood demonstrated engraftment. Once engraftment was documented we initiated part 2, reported here, in which patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood unit with a dose de-escalation design to determine the minimal cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. Eligible patients were aged 3-64 years, weighed 12 kg or more, had a haematological malignancy with an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and did not have a suitable HLA-matched donor, and a had a Karnofsky performance status score of 70% or more. Five clinical sites were planned to participate in the study; however, only two study sites opened, both of which only treated adult patients, thus no paediatric patients (aged <18 years) were recruited. Patients aged younger than 50 years without comorbidities received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, fludarabine 75 mg/m2, and 12 Gy total body irradiation) and patients aged older than 50 years and those with comorbidities received a less myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m2, and 4 Gy total body irradiation). Patients were infused with the 7-day UM171-expanded CD34-positive cells and the lymphocyte-containing CD34-negative fraction. The primary endpoints were feasibility of UM171 expansion, safety of the transplant, kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution (time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment) of UM171-expanded cord blood, and minimal pre-expansion cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. We analysed feasibility in all enrolled patients and all other primary outcomes were analysed per protocol, in all patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. This trial has been completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02668315. Finding(s): Between Feb 17, 2016, and Nov 11, 2018, we enrolled 27 patients, four of whom received two cord blood units for safety purposes in part 1 of the study. 23 patients were subsequently enrolled in part 2 to receive a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplant and 22 patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. At data cutoff (Dec 31, 2018), median follow-up was 18 months (IQR 12-22). The minimal cord blood unit cell dose at thaw that achieved prompt engraftment as a single cord transplant after UM171 expansion was 0.52 x 105 CD34-positive cells. We successfully expanded 26 (96%) of 27 cord blood units with UM171. Among the 22 patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation, median time to engraftment of 100 neutrophils per muL was 9.5 days (IQR 8-12), median time to engraftment of 500 neutrophils per muL was 18 days (12.5-20.0), and no graft failure occurred. Median time to platelet recovery was 42 days (IQR 35-47). The most common non-haematological adverse events were grade 3 febrile neutropenia (16 [73%] of 22 patients) and bacteraemia (nine [41%]). No unexpected adverse events were observed. One (5%) of 22 patients died due to treatment-related diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Interpretation(s): Our preliminary findings suggest that UM171 cord blood stem cell expansion is feasible, safe, and allows for the use of small single cords without compromising engraftment. UM171-expanded cord blood might have the potential to overcome the disadvantages of other cord blood transplants while maintaining the benefits of low risk of chronic GVHD and relapse, and warrants further investigation in randomised trials.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine in a randomised trial whether there is any significant difference in toxicity between modified CHOP and MCOP chemotherapy in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and to determine whether this reduced dose chemotherapy can be administered with full dose intensity, low toxicity and produce acceptable survival. Patients and Methods: Between 1993 and 2000, 155 eligible patients were randomised into this trial mainly from three centres (Nottingham, Birmingham and Leeds, UK). The patients were newly diagnosed with aggressive NHL and had a median age of 74 years (range 65-91 years). Ninety-six patients (62%) had bulky stage I or II disease; 59 patients (38%) had either stage III or IV disease; 77% had one or more extranodal sites involved at presentation; and 31% showed B symptoms. Seventy-seven patients were randomised to receive six cycles of modified CHOP (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 i.v., doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 i.v., vincristine 1 mg i.v. all on day 1 with prednisolone 20 mg bd for days 1-5) every 21 days and 78 patients to MCOP (mitozantrone 10 mg/m2 i.v. substituted for doxorubicin). Growth factors were not used routinely. After completion of chemotherapy, 39 patients received involved field radiotherapy (35-40 Gy) in 20 fractions. Result(s): One hundred and one patients (65%) completed all six cycles of chemotherapy. The median course dose intensity was 97%. The median follow-up for 53 surviving patients was 51 months. The median survival was 19 months (95% confidence interval 10-36 months) with an actuarial survival of 47% at 2 years and 42% at 3 years (CHOP versus MCOP, P = 0.79). There was no significant difference in any of the toxicities experienced with either CHOP or MCOP, except for white cell count (46 patients on MCOP and 27 patients on CHOP had grade 3 or 4 toxicity, P = 0.002) and red cell transfusion (37 patients, MCOP; 17 patients, CHOP; P = 0.001). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was documented in 75 patients (50%). One patient died from toxicity whilst in remission and seven patients died with septicaemia and persistent NHL. Conclusion(s): This multicentre randomised trial provides further information on the dose intensity achievable with CHOP or MCOP regimens in elderly patients (median age 74 years) with aggressive NHL. These dose-reduced regimens can be given with nearly 100% dose intensity with 65% of patients completing all the treatment. Survival is comparable to that observed with the more intensive regimens given in this age group.

AB  - Background: Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade have separately shown efficacy in some lymphoid malignancies, the safety of allo-SCT after anti-PD-1 therapy in these patients remains a high clinical interest. Aim(s): We present data from an analysis from 4 KEYNOTE phase 1-3 studies to describe predetermined complications in patients who received allo-SCT following pembrolizumab therapy. Method(s): The analysis included patients from the KEYNOTE-013 (NCT01953692, n=20), KEYNOTE-087 (NCT02453594, n=31), KEYNOTE-170 (NCT02576990, n=5), and KEYNOTE-204 (NCT02684292, n=14) trials who have a known allo-SCT transplantation date received within 2 years of the last dose of study pembrolizumab. Descriptive statistics were used for predefined post-allo-SCT complications of interest. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute grade 3-4 GVHD, and chronic GVHD was estimated. The corresponding competing risk events were death without acute grade 2-4 GVHD, death without acute grade 3-4 GVHD, and death without chronic GVHD, respectively. The cumulative incidence of post-allo-SCT transplantrelated mortality (TRM) was estimated with relapse as a competing risk. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventy patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 30 y (range, 18-65), 57 (81.4%) had classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), and the rest had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 69 of 70 (98.6%) patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy; 1 patient received pembrolizumab + lenalidomide. Median duration on study treatment was 5.3 months (range, 0.7-29.6) and median time from last pembrolizumab dose to first allo-SCT was 4.6 months (range, 1-20). Before transplantation, 49 patients (70.0%) had intervening anticancer regimen; 34 (48.6%) had active disease, 31 patients (44.3%) were in remission at time of transplant, and 5 patients (7.1%) had unknown disease status. Overall, 55 patients (78.6%) developed GVHD (acute, 38; chronic, 17). The estimated 6-month post-allo-SCT cumulative incidence was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.30-0.53) for grade II-IV acute GVHD and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.12-0.30) for grade III-IV acute GVHD; 1 year post-allo-SCT was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12-0.31) for chronic GVHD. Other predetermined complications, including critical illness, immune-mediated adverse events, pulmonary complications, and veno-occlusive liver disease, occurred in 32 patients (45.7%). After a median follow-up (defined as the time from allo-SCT to data cutoff) of 40.1 months (range, 5.1-71.2), the post-allo-SCT median PFS was not reached (NR) (95% CI, 14.5-NR) and the 30-month post-allo-SCT PFS rate was 56.8% (95% CI, 42.9-68.5) (Figure A); median OS was NR (95% CI, NR-NR) and the OS rate at 12 months was 82.2% (Figure B). The estimated post-allo-SCT cumulative incidence for TRM at 6 months was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.03-0.17) and for relapse at 26 months was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.16- 0.38). PFS and OS outcomes were comparable in the subgroup of patients with cHL. Summary/Conclusion: The incidence of GVHD in this population is comparable to historical data (40%-80% and 30%-70%, respectively). The incidence of severe acute GVHD may be higher than a typical modern allo-SCT series, although TRM was low. The observed PFS and OS outcomes compare favorably to historical benchmarks (2-year PFS ranging from 45%-48%; 1-year OS >80%). Altogether, this analysis lends confidence that allo-SCT is feasible for patients with lymphoid malignancies after PD-1 blockade. (Figure Presented).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pixantrone dimaleate (pixantrone)--a novel aza-anthracenedione--was synthesised to reduce anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity without compromising antitumour efficacy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pixantrone versus an investigator's choice of a single-agent therapy in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial at 66 hospitals in Europe, India, Russia, South America, the UK, and the USA, patients with histologically confirmed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed after two or more previous chemotherapy regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice response system to treatment with pixantrone dimaleate (85 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, for up to six cycles) or to a comparator (vinorelbine, oxaliplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mitoxantrone, or gemcitabine) given at prespecified standard doses and schedules. Patients were stratified by region, International Prognostic Index score, and previous stem-cell transplantation. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment; however, an independent assessment panel was masked. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete or unconfirmed complete response in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population at the end of treatment. Primary analyses of efficacy were based on the independent assessment panel's data review. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00088530. FINDINGS: The ITT population comprised 70 patients randomly assigned to the pixantrone group and 70 to the comparator. Five patients (two in the pixantrone group and three in the comparator group) dropped out before receiving their study drug. 14 patients (20·0% [95% CI 11·4-31·3]) who received pixantrone achieved a complete or unconfirmed complete response at end of treatment compared with four patients (5·7% [1·6-14·0]) in the comparator group (p = 0·021). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients given pixantrone were uncomplicated, non-cumulative neutropenia (28 [41·2%] of 68 patients vs 13 [19·4%] of 67 patients in the comparator group), leucopenia (16 [23·5%] vs five [7·5%]), and thrombocytopenia (eight [11·8%] vs seven [10·4%]). INTERPRETATION: Pixantrone, given as a single-agent salvage therapy in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is efficacious and tolerable. It could be a treatment option for patients whose aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma has failed to respond to at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. FUNDING: Cell Therapeutics, Inc.

AB  - We investigated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of two B-cell purging methods in patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving autologous stsem cell transplantation. Myeloid and immune recoveries between the methods were compared. Twenty-seven patients were randomised to either in vivo purging with rituximab or ex vivo purging by CD34+ cell selection. Both purging methods were efficient at eliminating B-cells in infusates. When compared with in vivo purging, ex vivo purging was associated with CD34+ cell loss and delayed median neutrophil (10 d vs. 11 d) and platelet (12.5 d vs. 17 d) count recoveries. Lymphocyte recovery was similar in both groups, but immunoglobulin recovery was delayed after in vivo purging. Late-infectious complications were few in both arms. At a median follow-up of 27 months, 2-year probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) rates were 81% for in vivo purging and 76% for ex vivo purging (P = 0.66). When compared with 53 unpurged patients, all 27 purged patients had improved 3-year probabilities of overall survival (89% vs. 70%, P = 0.014) and a trend for improved EFS (78% vs. 57%, P = 0.075). In conclusion, although both purging methods were feasible and safe, rituximab purging was superior as it did not impair CD34+ cell mobilisation and was associated with faster myeloid recovery. Further studies are needed to determine whether rituximab purging is more effective than the use of unpurged autografts.

AB  - DLBCL represent almost 30% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. More than 60% can be cured with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemoimmunotherapy. Patients not responding to R-CHOP often have a poor outcome, particularly those with disease refractory to frontline or subsequent therapies. Approximately 10-15% of patients treated with R-CHOP have primary refractory disease (incomplete response or relapse within 6 months after treatment) and additional 20-25% will relapse after an initial response, typically within the first 2 years. Patients with late relapses (>2 years after treatment) have better prognosis. Patients who are eligible to curative therapy should undergo full restaging to fully assess the status of their disease and to assess prognosis. A repeat biopsy at the time of relapse should strongly be considered to ensure that an alternate histology is not present, as an indolent lymphoma has been reported on repeat biopsy in approximately 17% of cases with late relapses. Gene expression profiling has delineated two distinct molecular subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell like (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC); 10-15% of cases are unclassifiable. Detailed analysis of molecular aberrations have led to proposals of new unique, genetically defined subtypes beyond the cell of origin. Transplant-eligible patients. Treatment with high-dose chemoimmunotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) offers the best chance of cure in patients with chemotherapy sensitive relapsed or refractory DLBCL, but due to advanced age and coexisting medical conditions only half of such patients are considered transplantation candidates. Approximately 50% of patients respond to initial salvage therapy and then undergo ASCT, with an overall cure rate of 25 to 35%. Management of transplant-ineligible patients. While some elderly fit patients may be eligible to ASCT and exhibit comparable outcomes to younger patients, the majority will have comorbidities that will prevent intensive chemo-immunotherapeutic approach. Few prospective trials have been conducted in elderly patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. The combination of R-GEMOX and R-bendamustine have been used for paliative purposes. For these cases, new approaches are warranted and new FDA approved drugs will be discussed on new drugs session. CAR-T cell therapy represents a major paradigm shift in the management of relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Three products, axicabtagene ciloleucil (axi-cel), tisagenlecleusil (tisa-cel) and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) are FDA-approved as third line treatment of DLBCL and are commercially available. In pivotal studies, axi-cel, tisa-cel and liso-cel have been associated with overall and complete response rates in the range of 52-82% and 40-54%, respectively, among patients with R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma. All three agents had characteristic toxicity profile with severe (grade > 3) CRS in 1-22% of patients, and severe (grade > 3) neurotoxicity in 12-28% of patients. Long-term outcome of ZUMA-1 trial recently published and 4 year OS is 41%, median OS is 25.8 months (17), on the other hand in Juliet trial, 5 year PFS is 31%. Novel therapies. Despite the advance of CAR-T cell therapy, novel therapies are needed. Several agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Polatuzumab-Bendamustin-Rituksimab has received approval based of randomised phase 2 trial involving transplantation ineligible patients with significant improvement rates of complete metabolic response, PFS and OS as compared with BR alone. Selinexor has also received approval for patients with R/R DLBCL who have received at least two lines of therapy, as a phase 2 study has shown modest single-agent acitivity. Tafasitamab is a humanised anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody with augmented Fc gama receptor afinity. Results from a phase 2 study of tafasitamab combined with lenalidomide showed efficacy, leading to regulatory approval for patients DLBCL ineligible to transplantation. Bispesific antibodies (bsAbs) refers to an antibody that has binding specificities for two different antigens. A variety of bsAbs are currently under development as therapy for B-cell lymphoma. These bsAbs target CD20 on B-cell and engage T-cells by CD3 in a 1:1 or 2:1 CD20:CD3 Fab format. In general, CRS and neurotoxicity are significantly less frequent than observed with CD-19 directed or blinatumomab therapies. In R/R DLBCL, ORR range from 37 to 90% with CRR from 19 to 55%. However, follow-up for these new bsAbs is short and the durability of responses remains to be established. Loncastuximab tesirine is a CD-19 directed antibody-drug conjugate. It has substantial single-agent antitumour activity and produces durable responses with an acceptible safety profile. 145 patients were enrolled with diagnosis of R/R DLBCL including high-risk characteristics for poor prognosis such as double-hit, triple-hit, transformed or primary refractory DLBCL. ORR was 48% with 24% CR rate, potencially offering a new therapeutic option for heavily pre-treated patients with R/R DLBCL.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Introduction In vivo T-cell depletion is increasingly integrated into RIC regimens as a strategy to reduce the risk of GVHD. However, this manoeuvre is associated with an increased incidence of mixed T cell chimerism which may increase the risk of disease relapse. DLI is commonly administered to achieve full donor T cell chimerism (FDTC) and treat relapse, however, it can be complicated by potentially severe and lifethreatening GVHD. There remain few studies looking at the toxicity or efficacy of DLI in the setting of a T cell depleted RIC allograft. Patients and Methods We studied the outcomes of 222 adult patients receiving DLI (matched sibling donor n=121 and adult unrelated donor n=101[21 antigenic HLA mismatches]) following allo-HSCT between 1999 and 2014 at three large UK centres. Indications for transplant were AML (n=75), NHL (n=28), CLL (n=23), MDS (n=21), CML (n=19), HL (n=16), other MPN (n=15), MM (n=14) and ALL (n=11). Most patients received a fludarabine based RIC regimen (n=200) and 204 received additional in vivo T cell depletion utilising either Alemtuzumab (n=200) or ATG (n= 4). Patients received between 1-6 (median 2) doses of DLI. The first dose of DLI was infused at a median of 283 days post-transplant (48-4510). 110 patients received DLI pre-emptively as treatment of MDTC (<95% CD3+ donor cells). 112 patients received DLI for relapse with 58 receiving prior additional cytotoxic therapy. The total dose of DLI varied between 0.1 and 215x106 CD3+ T cells (median total dose 1x107). The median follow up after administration of first DLI was 26 months (5-6152 days). Result(s): Toxicity: Grade II-IV and III-IV GvHD occurred in 36 (16%) and 23 (10%) of patients respectively, at a median of 44 days after DLI. 10 (5%) of patients experienced fatal GvHD. In multivariate analysis the initial dose of CD3+ cells (p=0.013) predicted the development of aGVHD. Of note, patient: donor HLA disparity did not increase the risk or severity of GVHD. Five patients (2.3%) developed graft aplasia. Efficacy: The 1 and 5 year overall survival (OS) after DLI administration was 78 and 59%, respectively. Of the 110 patients receiving DLI for treatment of MDTC, 103 had chimerism data following the last DLI available, of whom 85% achieved full donor T cell chimerism. In multivariate analysis the only factor predicting acquisition of FDTC was the dose of DLI. Timing of DLI post-transplant or absolute lymphocyte count did not determine response. The 5-yr OS of patients achieving FDTC as compared to those who did not was 81% versus 43%. Of patients achieving FDTC, 20% subsequently relapsed. 112 patients received DLI for cytogenetic/molecular (n=31) or morphological (n=81) disease relapse. 22/31 (71%) and 23/81 (28%) achieved CR in the above subgroups. In multivariate analyses the only factor that significantly influenced survival was whether CR was achieved. Patients achieving CR after DLI had a 5-yr OS of 96%, compared to 15% in patients who did not (p<0.001). Conclusion In this largest study to date, we conclude that DLI is an effective treatment option for MDTC and associated with a low risk of severe GVHD. Whilst survival in patients relapsing post-allograft is poor, DLI has the capacity to deliver long term survival in up to 70% of patients treated early. Our data provide the basis for a randomised clinical trial of DLI in MDTC and support the use of post-transplant monitoring of residual disease permitting pre-emptive delivery of DLI when it is most effective.

AB  - Patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia or aggressive lymphoma not only suffer from the direct side effects of chemotherapy such as infections due to long-lasting immuno-suppression and aplasia, but also from marked fatigue and the inability to do normal physical activity. Furthermore, especially in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia, doctors recommend abstaining from physical exercise due to the risk of potential bleeding and tissue damage. The normally recommended cutoff level to perform exercise is 50,000 platelets per microliter or haemoglobin of 8 g/dl. This leads to a vicious cycle of loosing physical strength and muscles with subsequent development of treatment-related cachexia and an increased treatment mortality. As number of publications focus on the importance of physical exercise in patients with solid tumours, increasing evidence is found that suggests positive effects on major clinical endpoints such as rate of infection, quality of life and even relapse rate and overall survival. With this work, we intended to address whether intense supervised ergometer training is feasible in patients with severe pancytopenia and whether it has any effect on patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study was initiated as the groundwork for a large phase III randomised trial. © 2009 The Japanese Society of Hematology.

AB  - Purpose: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at risk for cognitive decline. Cross-sectional studies show patients' complaints of cognitive decline do not correlate well with concurrently measured objective neuropsychological performance, but rather with emotional variables and health-related quality of life. This longitudinal study investigated whether patient self-report of cognitive status would be concordant with objectively measured neuropsychological performance after accounting for change from their own pre-transplant objective baseline. Method(s): Pre-HSCT and at 30 and 100 days post-HSCT, 46 patients underwent computerized neuropsychological testing (CogState) and completed surveys assessing patient-reported cognitive complaints, emotional symptoms (depression, anxiety), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and physical and functional well-being. Correlations were calculated between cognitive complaints and neuropsychological performance (at each time-point and across time-points), as well as all other patient-reported variables. Result(s): Patient-reported cognitive complaints were largely independent of concurrently assessed objective neuropsychological performance. Uniquely, our longitudinal data demonstrated significant medium to large effect size associations between subjective cognitive complaints post-HSCT with objectively measured change from pre-HSCT in attention, visual learning, and working memory (p <.05-.01). Subjective cognitive complaints post-HSCT were also associated with depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness and physical well-being (p <.05-.001). Conclusion(s): Patients appear better able to assess their cognitive functioning relative to their own baseline and changes across time rather than relative to community norms. Thus, patient complaints of cognitive compromise justify further in-depth neuropsychological, emotional, and functional assessment. Future research into relationships between cognitive complaints and neuropsychological performance should account for changes in performance over time.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common subtypes of lymphoma in Western countries, accounting for 10-20% of all newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Clinical course of FL is typically indolent, with impressive responses to initial treatments. Nevertheless, frequent relapses with shorter remission duration occur that need additional therapeutic interventions and increase the risk of drug resistance. Treatment options for treatment-naive or recurring follicular lymphoma patients are still controversial, ranging from watch and wait to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. When a treatment is indicated, chemotherapy is usually prescribed. In most recent years, the advent of anti CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab (R) has dramatically changed the approach to this disease, and immunochemotherapy is at present considered the standard of care for patients diagnosed with high tumor burden FL, leading at advances in Progression Free Survival ( PFS) and Overall Survival(OS)1-3. Discussion(s): In order to prolong remission duration, the use of maintenance strategies after the first treatment has been considered over a long time. The use of interferon was first evaluated, showing benefits in terms of duration of remission and survival4; however, the safety profile of the drug and the low manageability of treatment has led most physicians to abandon this treatment option. The availability of rituximab as an effective and low toxic single agent has suggested to explore the possibility to use it not only to improve efficacy of chemotherapy in first line therapy, but also to delay progression after initial treatment reflecting the ideal maintenance strategy which involve clinical benefit, good tolerance and convenient administration. The PRIMA trial clearly showed that rituximab maintenance in patients achieving a response to initial chemoimmunotherapy results in an improved outcome in terms of prolonged PFS and made a step forward in the management of patients with FL5. However, one important question that can be raised is whether this approach is really needed for all patients with FL or if some of them could benefit from a risk adapted maintenance strategy, intensifying treatment in those recognized at high risk of recurrence, and reducing it in patients at lower risk. For example, in patients with low tumor burden who received front line rituximab, the RESORT study clearly showed that retreatment with rituximab instead rituximab maintenance was associated with an excellent outcome (86% chemotherapy free at 3 years), lack of Quality of Life difference and fewer rituximab doses required. 6 Recently, response to therapy assessed either with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) or with highly sensitive molecular techniques targeting the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (Minimal residual disease - MRD) have been suggested as important prognostic factors and are both identified as pivotal tools to achieve the goal of personalized treatment. The predictive value of PET and MRD is clearly recognized based on a large bulk of published evidence, and might be used to better tailoring post induction treatment in patients achieving satisfactory response with rituximab containing regimens. Post-induction FDG-PET provides powerful prognostic information in FL. About 80-85% of patients achieve a complete metabolic response (CMR) following immunochemotherapy and have an excellent outcome irrespective of whether rituximab maintenance is given (~95% survival at 6 years). In contrast, the ~15-20% of patients who fail to achieve a CMR are expected to have a significantly worse outcome.7, 8 Several studies indicate that, regardless to the treatment administered, the absence in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of neoplastic cells bearing the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement during the follow-up was strongly associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, clearly suggesting the need for MRD detection in FL 9-12 In the year 2012 the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) launched the prospective randomized FOLL12 trial, with the aim of verifying whether combining clinical response assessed on FDG-PET scan and molecular response measured through MRD detection could permit to single out patients at different risk of progression and to consequently modulate maintenance. In April, 2018 the planned accrual has been reached, with the accrual of 807 cases. Patients randomized to standard Arm received two years of rituximab maintenance according to the PRIMA schedule. Those in the experimental Arm and at low risk defined by post induction PET and MDR negativity, did not receive any further maintenance; however, 4 weekly doses of rituximab were allowed in case of MDR positivity during follow-up, for a maximum of three re-treatments. On the contrary, patients at high risk (post induction PET positive), received intensified maintenance with (90)Y Ibritumomab Tiuxetan followed by rituximab maintenance for 2 years. Some very preliminary analyses of the study will be presented at conference site. Conclusion(s): Despite rituximab maintenance has shown its beneficial effect in prolonging PFS, its ability in improving OS is still questionable. In this context we believe that the results of the FOLL12 study would provide a more rationale use of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic resources, thus offering the opportunity of better tailoring maintenance therapy in patients responding to first line chemoimmunotherapy.

AB  - Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a distinct sub-group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas which the Working Formulation categorises as high grade malignancy. It is characterised at diagnosis by frequent mediastinal involvement. However, bone marrow and subsequent peripheral blood involvement are common. From a histologic and cytologic point of view it is identical to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Sequential chemotherapy has improved the prognosis of this lymphoma in terms of survival and disease free survival (DFS). However, there are a series of negative prognostic factors present at diagnosis which seem to reduce survival and DFS due to the high risk of relapse. For this reason, small groups of patients in complete remission were treated with high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) after conventional chemotherapy. An international randomised study is at present underway to determine the usefulness of ABMT for patients responding to front line therapy.

AB  - Mosunetuzumab (M), a CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody, has demonstrated high and consistent response rates in high-risk relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) patients (pts), with early evidence of a favourable benefit/risk profile. Lenalidomide (Len) is clinically active in FL pts. M + Len offers potentially additive/ synergistic efficacy via potent immunomodulatory activity. We present data from an ongoing Phase Ib study (NCT04246086) evaluating safety and activity of M + Len in R/R FL pts. Pts with R/R FL (Grade [Gr] 1-3a) and >=1 prior systemic anti-cancer therapy were enrolled to receive 12 cycles of M + Len (Cycle [C]1 duration: 21 days; C2-12: 28 days). In C1, step-up doses of M (intravenous [IV] infusion) were given on Day (D)1 (1 mg), and D8 (2mg), with the target dose (30 mg) given on C1D15 and on D1 of C2-12. Len (20 mg) was administered orally on D1-21 of C2-12. No hospitalisation was mandated. Primary objective: to evaluate M + Len safety. Secondary objective: to assess response and long-term efficacy outcomes. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria, responses were assessed with PET-CT using standard criteria. At data cut-off (31 May 2021) 27 pts were enrolled. The median age was 59 years (range: 31-79 years), 12 pts (44%) were male and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (18 pts, 67%) or 1 (9 pts, 33%). The median number of prior therapy lines was 1 (1-4); three pts (11%) had disease progression (PD) <24 months (m) from the start of first-line therapy. Sixteen pts (59%) had been on study for 0-3 m, 8 (30%) for 3-6 m, 2 (7%) for 6-9 m and 1 for >9 m. Twenty pts (74%) experienced >=1 adverse event (AE) of any Gr. The most common AE was CRS (8 pts, 30%). Gr3-4 AEs and serious AEs occurred in eight pts (30%) each. There were no Gr5 AEs. AEs relating to M and Len occurred in 20 (74%) and 10 pts (37%) respectively. No AEs led to the withdrawal of M or Len; two pts had M-related AEs leading to M dose delays, six pts (22%) had Len-related AEs leading to Len dose interruption and/or reduction. CRS events were Gr1 (7/8 pts) or Gr2 (1/8 pts). Six out of eight pts experienced CRS events in C1D1-7; two out of eight had Gr1 CRS events in C2. The median time to CRS onset was 1 day after the first dose (1-28 days); median duration was 3 days (2-5 days). All CRS events were resolved without sequelae. No pts required tocilizumab, ICU admission, high flow oxygen, or vasopressor support. Five pts (19%) reported 14 events of Gr3-4 neutropenia between D41 and 218, lasting 6-16 days, all resolved, with one pt receiving primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis and two pts receiving G-CSF treatment. No febrile neutropenia events occurred. The efficacy-evaluable population (13 pts) included all pts who had been assessed for response at any time on the study, withdrawn from treatment/study prior to reaching their first response assessment, or were on the study long enough to reach their first scheduled response assessment (planned per protocol for D15-21). The objective response rate at data cutoff was 92%. Complete (10 pts, 77%) and partial (2 pts, 15%) metabolic response (PMR) and stable disease (1 pt, 8%) were observed. One pt with initial PMR experienced PD after C8. M + Len appears to have an acceptable safety profile in R/R FL pts with >=1 prior therapy line and encouraging preliminary anti-lymphoma activity. These data support initiation of a randomised Phase III study of M + Len versus rituximab+Len.

AB  - Aims. Follicular lymphoma WHO grade I or II (FL) in early stage nodal disease can be treated effectively by radiotherapy alone. The extent of optimal target volumes remains controversial with a high rate of relapse (REL) out-field after Involved field irradiation, but higher toxicity and potentially risks of secondary neoplasia after large field techniques. Therefore, this study aimed to determine curative age-adapted irradiation volumes in younger [randomized trial (RD)] and standardized radiotherapy in elderly [prospective observation trial (OBS)] FL patients (pts). Methods. In FL stage I-II and limited stage III disease, pts<=65 years (ys) were randomized to Extended field (EF) or Total lymphatic irradiation (TLI), dose 30 Gy + boost 10 or 14 Gy. Pts aged 66-75 ys were treated with EF, all pts>75 ys with involved field (IF) radiotherapy. Results. A total of qualified 255 pts were recruited. In the RD trial, 202 pts were randomized to EF or TNI, median age 54 ys. In the OBS trial 53 pts, median age 70 ys, were treated with EF (79%) or IF (21%). At 5 ys after recruitment, overall survival of all pts is 97% at a median observation period of 77 months, relapse- (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are 60% and 60% at six years. Complete remissions (CR) were 93%, REL were 33%, median interval 27 months. In the RD pts, significant differences emerge in favor of TNI vs. EF treatment with PFS p=0.002 and RFS p=0.03. REL developed predominantly as new manifestations (92%, 77% new site alone), more often out-of than in-field. REL were entirely nodal (76%). New sites were in 75% located on the opposing side of the diaphragm. REL-histologies, revealing transition into secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 29% of biopsied pts (22% of all REL, 7% of all study pts), median 29 months from diagnosis. Secondary tumors were observed in 25 of all pts (10%) (8 EF-pts, 7 TNI-pts; 10 OBS trial-pts) and included AML/MDS (n=5), skin tumors (n=5), prostrate cancer (n=4), breast cancer (n=3), cancer of the oesophagus, the bladder, the stomach, the cervix uteri, angiosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease (<=2 cases each), at a median interval of 70 months. In the RD trial 14 pts (7%) died, 12/14 pts (86%) after progress/relapse and further diseases (8/9 in the EF, 4/5 in the TNI arm), and one each of myocardial infarction and sepsis. In the OBS trial three pts died (relapse/senile decay/MDS). Conclusions. In early stage nodal FL, standardized RT easily induced high rates of CR with excellent survival. In the randomised trial remission stability was significantly improved by TNI as opposed to EF, while the risk of secondary neoplasms was similar in both treatment arms. However, in the meantime, regional radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy has been evaluated in FL and molecular and cytogenetic factors may contribute to the identification of patients for these newer treatment approaches.

AB  - Half-body irradiation at a single dose of 400-800 cGy was delivered to patients with disseminated fast-growing types of lymphomas and large aggregates of tumors and vital dysfunction of the body (the compression syndrome). Active detoxification therapy including heparinization, hemodilution with enforced diuresis and hemosorption was performed to prevent the syndrome of acute tumor lysis and postradiation complications. This treatment modality resulted in the elimination of clinical manifestations of the compression syndrome, normalization of the body homeostasis, a considerable reduction of the volume of tumor aggregates on a short-term basis, entering the patients into a curable state; the 5-year follow-up results were evaluated.
