AB  - Anaemia is a common complication in the treatment of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but there are no published data on the effect of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in such patients. This is the first open-label, phase II, dose-finding study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.). Ninety-three anaemic patients with aggressive NHL who were receiving chemotherapy (including many advanced NHL, heavily pretreated patients) were randomised to receive 2.1, 4.2 or 6.3 mug/kg C.E.R.A. subcutaneously once every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Haematopoietic response was achieved in 45%, 57% and 65% of patients at the respective dose level. During weeks 5-13, the mean haemoglobin changes from baseline in the intent-to-treat population were increases of 0.2, 2.4, and 5.7 g/l in the 2.1, 4.2, and 6.3 mug/kg treatment groups, respectively, and 4.4, 5.7 and 6.8 g/l in the per-protocol population at the respective dose levels. C.E.R.A. was generally well tolerated in all three groups. C.E.R.A. appeared to have dose-dependent clinical activity in most anaemic patients with aggressive NHL who were receiving chemotherapy. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) experience multiple relapses necessitating subsequent lines of therapy. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies, showed promising activity in FL in a phase 1 study. We report the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating ibrutinib in recurrent FL. Forty patients with recurrent FL were treated with ibrutinib 560 mg/d until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Exploratory analyses included correlations of outcome with recurrent mutations identified in a cancer gene panel that used next-generation sequencing in pretreatment biopsies from 31 patients and results of early interim positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans in 20 patients. ORR was 37.5% with a complete response rate of 12.5%, median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14 months, and 2-year PFS of 20.4%. Response rates were significantly higher among patients whose disease was sensitive to rituximab (52.6%) compared with those who were rituximab refractory (16.7%) (P = .04). CARD11 mutations were present in 16% of patients (5 of 31) and predicted resistance to ibrutinib with only wild-type patients responding (P = .002). Maximum standardized uptake value at cycle 1 day 8 correlated with response and PFS. Ibrutinib was well-tolerated with a toxicity profile similar to labeled indications. Ibrutinib is a well-tolerated treatment with modest activity in relapsed FL. Evaluation of BTK inhibitors in earlier lines of therapy may be warranted on the basis of improved response rates in rituximab-sensitive disease. Somatic mutations such as CARD11 may have an impact on response to ibrutinib, may inform clinical decisions, and should be evaluated in larger data sets. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01849263.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of patients with DLBCL who are unsuitable for anthracycline containing chemotherapy remains a clinical challenge. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue which has proven efficacy in the relapse setting in both non Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. We therefore developed a protocol incorporating Gemcitabine in a first line approach combined with CVP-R chemo-immunotherapy in DLBCL patients considered unfit for anthracycline containing chemotherapy. Method(s): We performed a prospective, multicentre phase II trial in patients with DLCBL who were considered unfit for anthracycline containing chemo-immunotherapy. Eligibility criteria included ejection fraction < 50%, or ejection fraction >= 50% but with the presence of attendant significant co-morbidities (including: ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus), and ECOG PS 0-3. Patients received 6 cycles of Rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV D1), Cyclophosphamide (750mg/m2 IV D1), Vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 IV D1), Prednisolone (100mg, orally D1-5) and Gemcitabine IV D1 and D8. The Gemcitabine dose, if tolerated was sequentially escalated from 750mg/m2 in cycle 1 to 875mg/m2 in cycle 2 to 1000mg/m2 in cycle 3 with the dose maintained at 1000mg/m2 for cycles 4-6. Cycles were repeated every 21 days with growth factor support administered on day 9 of each cycle (pegfilgrastrim 6mg s/c).The primary endpoint was to achieve an overall response rate of > 40% assessed by CT scan at the end of treatment according to the Cheson criteria. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival and overall survival. Result(s): 62 patients were recruited from 32 UK sites over a 28 month period from April 2008 to July 2010. 66% were male. Median age was 76 years (range 52-90), 48 (77%) were > 70 years. 43 (69%) had stage III/IV disease and 46 (72%) had high - intermediate or high IPI (3-5) disease. ECOG performance status was >= 2 in 50% patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was < 50% in 28 patients (45%). The 34 patients with LVEF >= 50% had significant co-morbidities, 22 (65%) had multiple co-morbidities. 44 (70%) received >= 3 cycles of treatment, reasons for early termination of treatment in the remaining 18 patients were progression (n=2), toxicity (n=5), death (n=6) patient choice (n=1) and other (n=4). 29 patients (47%) received the full 6 cycles. A total of 250 treatment cycles were delivered. Of the 44 patients who received >= 3 cycles of treatment, the dose of Gemcitabine was escalated to the full dose (1000mg/m2) in 67%. Day 8 Gemcitabine was delivered in 215/250 (86%) cycles of treatment. The overall response rate (CR/CRu/PR) at end of treatment for all 62 patients was 60%. For patients who received >= 3 cycles of treatment (n =44) the ORR was 79.5% at the end of treatment. There was no significant difference in ORR between those with LVEF <50% and those with LVEF >= 50% (71% vs 53%, p=0.155). At a median follow up of 18.2 months the 1 year progression free survival rate for all patients was 52.9% (95% CI 39.4-64.8). The 1 year overall survival (OS) rate is 62.4% (95% CI 48.5-73.6). For the group with LVEF <50% OS was 70.8% (95% CI: 48.4, 84.9) and LVEF group >= 50% OS was 55.9% (95% CI 37.1-71).Grade 3/4 haematological toxicity was observed in 54.1% patients. Grade 3/4 infection was observed in 24.6% of patients. The death rate observed related to infection for the whole cohort was 11%. Conclusion(s): This multicentre trial demonstrates that the R-GCVP regimen delivers excellent overall response rates with durable remissions in a group of patients where anthracycline use was precluded. The efficacy attained in this difficult group of patients provides a platform for testing the regimen in subsequent randomised phase II and phase III studies to confirm its efficacy.

AB  - We studied the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 220 mg/m2 melphalan (HDM 220) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in 16 patients with advanced haematological malignancies. Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean values of steady-state volume of distribution 14.6 l/m2, total body clearance 313 ml/min/m2, elimination half-life 46 min) were the same as those of 140 or 200 mg/m2 melphalan in previous reports. HDM 220 was feasible. Extramedullary toxicity was mainly W.H.O. grade 4 mucositis (13/16 patients). The median duration of 41 d (10, not reached) of thrombocytopenia < 25 x 10(9)/l was long. In multiple myeloma the response rate was 89% in heavily pretreated patients, suggesting that HDM 220 could be considered earlier in the course of the disease as an alternative consolidation therapy.

AB  - Objectives: Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to mobilise haematopoietic stem cells. Biosimilar filgrastim is now available in Europe. No differences were observed between biosimilar filgrastim (n=40) and a retrospective cohort of patients receiving originator filgrastim for stem cell mobilisation in a previous comparison, although no safety findings were reported (Lefrere et al. Adv Ther 2011;28:304-10). We compared the efficacy and safety of a biosimilar filgrastim (Zarzio, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) with originator filgrastim (Neupogen, Amgen) in patients with haematological malignancies. Method(s): A total of 108 patients were included in this study, 59 of whom were female (49 male), with an overall median age of 51 years (range 19-69). Patients had multiple myeloma (n=46), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=26), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=28) or other diagnosis (n=8). Median time from diagnosis to mobilisation was 10 months (range 3-122). After administration of mobilising regimens (primarily high-dose etoposide, high-dose cyclophosphamide, intermediate-dose Ara C or ESHAP), patients were randomised to a standard daily 10 mug/kg dose of Zarzio (n=54) or Neupogen (n=54). Result(s): Median duration of G-CSF administration was 8 days with both Zarzio (range 4-17) and Neupogen (range 4-14). Both groups had a median of one apheresis with a median time until first apheresis of 11 days. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the median (range) number of mobilised CD34+ cells/muL in peripheral blood (Zarzio, 62.0 [2-394]; Neupogen, 47.5 [2-370]) or the number of CD34+ cells/ kg body weight (Zarzio, 9.1 [0-23]; Neupogen, 9.4 [6-48]). Five patients (9%) in each group did not mobilise sufficient CD34+ cells. The adverse event profile was comparable between the Zarzio and Neupogen groups, with similar occurrence of neutropenic fever (9 vs 11 patients) and bone pain (8 vs 6 patients). Conclusion(s): Zarzio demonstrated similar efficacy and safety as the reference filgrastim (Neupogen) in haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in patients with haematological malignancies.

AB  - Despite the greater risk of adverse COVID‐19 outcomes, antibody and cell‐mediated immune responses to COVID‐19 vaccines vary amongst immunocompromised (IC) people and are poorly defined. IC hosts were largely excluded from the COVID‐19 vaccine registration trials, though many countries recommend additional and booster doses of vaccination in this group. However, data are heterogeneous, in part due the variable nature of immunodeficiencies in IC groups and non‐standardised outcome measures used in studies. BOOST‐IC is an adaptive randomised clinical trial (RCT) to assess the immunogenicity and safety of additional COVID‐19 vaccine doses in immunocompromised (IC) people, including people with HIV, solid organ transplants (SOT) recipients or those with haematological malignancies. Briefly, the study aims to generate high‐quality evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of alternative COVID‐19 booster strategies against SARS‐CoV‐2 for IC people in Australia. To do this, participants who have previously completed 3‐ to 5‐doses of Australian TGA approved COVID‐19 vaccine (mRNA, ChAdOx‐1, Novavax) will be randomised 1:1:1 to one of 3 arms of vaccine boosting, namely: (i) single dose Pfizer, (ii) single dose Moderna or (iii) single dose Novavax. Participants who have undetectable anti‐spike SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies after 28 days (i.e. seronegative) will be secondarily randomised to an additional booster dose of COVID‐19 vaccine. Patients will be followed up for 455 days post randomisation. Specific study questions pertain to: ‐ examining how additional doses of COVID‐19 vaccine/s affect correlates of protective immunity ‐ examining the safety of additional doses of COVID‐19 vaccine/s ‐ characterising the humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID‐19 vaccination receiving 1 or 2 booster doses of COVID‐19 vaccine/s     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 2.3694698766801263     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - This trial is designed as an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, treatment optimisation study, preceded by safety run-in phases conducted for B-cell and T-cell lymphoma separately. Aim of the phase-III trial is to test whether prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodg-kin Lymphoma not eligible for neither autologous nor alloge-neic stem cell transplantation can be improved by combining nivolumab with (R)-GemOx. Population: All patients with frst relapse or progression of an aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma aged older than 65 years or older than 18 years with HCT-CI score > 2 are eligible for this study irrespective of their gender or stage of disease. Tere is no upper limit of age. Also patients not eligible for neither autologous nor allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible for this study. Primary objective: Improvement of 1-yr PFS by nivolumab plus (R)-GemOx followed by nivolumab consolidation instead of (R)-GemOx alone. Primary endpoint is 1-yrs progression-free survival.

AB  - In this second part of the review the clinical significance of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) as treatment for acute leukemias (AL) and malignant lymphomas is described. In most adult patients with AL in complete remission treated with conventional maintenance therapy relapse usually occurs within one year. However, the results of ABMT, as an intensive consolidation treatment in patients with AL in remission show long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of 40% of patients. Even better results have been reported in patients with purged bone marrow, although the difference is not statistically significant. A major problem of ABMT is still the high percentage of relapse (50%), while the probability of treatment related mortality is relatively low (up to 10%). ABMT is also showing good results in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of intermediate and high-grade histology and in Hodgkin's disease in cases refractory to the first line therapy and in sensitive relapse. However, in refractory cases the results are poor. It is noteworthy, that in all disorders treated with ABMT, prospective randomised controlled trials are missing and current data are based on heterogenous groups of patients. In the majority of solid tumors, even escalated doses of radiochemotherapy with ABMT are not able to eradicate malignant disease. In contrast, the results are very good in neuroblastoma. Although ABMT is a relatively complex and aggressive method, it is being increasingly applied to the treatment of haematological malignant diseases and the results obtained so far, are encouraging and showing that ABMT, besides allogeneic BMT, represents a promising potentially curative treatment for selected group of patients.

AB  - Real-world practice patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), including the adoption of maintenance rituximab (MR) therapy in the United States (US), have been reported in few studies since the release of the National LymphoCare Study almost a decade ago. We analyzed data from the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), to identify rates of adoption and effectiveness of MR in FL patients after first-line (1L) treatment. We identified previously untreated patients with FL in the VHA between 2006 and 2014 who achieved at least stable disease after chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy. Among these patients, those who initiated MR within 238 days of 1L composed the MR group, whereas those who did not were classified as the non-MR group. We examined the effect of MR on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 676 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 300 received MR. MR was associated with significant PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55, P <.001) and OS (HR = 0.53, P =.005) compared to the non-MR group, after adjusting by age, sex, ethnicity, geographic region, diagnosis period, stage, grade at diagnosis, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 1L treatment regimen, and response to 1L treatment. These results suggest that in FL patients who do not experience disease progression after 1L treatment in real-world settings, MR is associated with a significant improvement in both PFS and OS. Maintenance therapy should be considered in FL patients who successfully complete and respond to 1L therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)polatuzumab vedotin (pola)and pinatuzumab vedotin (pina)showed clinical activity and tolerability in phase 1 trials. The aim of this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study was to compare rituximab plus pola (R-pola)or pina (R-pina)in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Method(s): In this phase 2 randomised study at 39 investigational sites in six countries, patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of a dynamic hierarchical randomisation scheme, to receive R-pola or R-pina (375 mg/m2 rituximab plus 2.4 mg/kg ADCs)every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 1 year. Treatment allocations were not masked to the investigator, patients or sponsor after the patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability, and antitumour response. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01691898, and is closed to accrual. Finding(s): 81 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 42 with follicular lymphoma were recruited between Sept 27, 2012, and Oct 10, 2013, and were assigned to treatment. 81 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41 patients with follicular lymphoma were eligible for analysis. Of the 42 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received R-pina, 25 (60%, 95% CI 43-74)achieved an objective response and 11 (26%, 95% CI 14-42)achieved a complete response. Of the 39 patients in this cohort who received R-pola, 21 (54%, 95% CI 37-70)achieved an objective response, and eight (21%, 95% CI 9-36)achieved a complete response. Of the 21 patients in the follicular lymphoma cohort who received R-pina, 13 (62%, 95% CI 38-82)achieved an objective response, and one (5%, 95% CI 0.1-24)achieved a complete response. Of the 20 patients in this cohort who received R-pola, 14 (70%, 95% CI 46-88)achieved an objective response, and nine (45%, 95% CI 23-68)achieved a complete response. In the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort, grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 33 (79%)of 42 patients receiving R-pina (most common were neutropenia [29%]and hyperglycaemia [10%]; nine [21%]grade 5 adverse events, five of which were infection-related), and in 30 (77%)of 39 patients receiving R-pola (most common were neutropenia [23%], anaemia [8%]and diarrhoea [8%]; no grade 5 adverse events). In the follicular lymphoma cohort, grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 13 (62%)of 21 patients receiving R-pina (most common were neutropenia [29%]and hyperglycaemia [14%]; no grade 5 adverse events)and in ten (50%)of 20 patients receiving R-pola (most common were neutropenia [15%]and diarrhoea [10%]; one grade 5 adverse event). Interpretation(s): R-pina and R-pola are potential treatment options in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Pola was selected by the study funder for further development in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, partly because of longer durations of response than pina, and an overall benefit-risk favouring R-pola.

AB  - Disseminated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy regimens, and more than 50% of patients die within 5 years of their first relapse. Therefore, newer treatment approaches have been used to try to improve survival and ultimately provide a cure for patients with disseminated indolent NHL. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been extensively evaluated and is now an integral component of many treatment strategies. The activity of rituximab was first shown in the pivotal trial in patients with relapsed and refractory low-grade and follicular lymphoma. More recent studies have shown somewhat higher activity of rituximab when used first-line, with further improvements with maintenance therapy. Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to achieve high response rates, and two prospective randomized studies from the German Low-grade Lymphoma Study Group have shown significantly higher response rates and longer survival for patients receiving rituximab concurrently with chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Further data from ongoing phase III studies are still needed to determine whether rituximab can help alter the natural history of indolent NHL, and longer follow-up of these patients will help determine the optimal role for rituximab in treatment of indolent NHL. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mucosal toxicity is dose limiting for etoposide. This may be related to the direct effects of etoposide on the mucosa. Twelve patients receiving etoposide 1800 mg/m2 as part of a myeloablative pre-transplant regimen were randomized to receive propantheline 30 mg or placebo orally every 6 h for six doses. Mucositis was less frequent (2 of 6 vs 5 of 6) and less severe (p = 0.05) in the propantheline arm. There were no differences in tumor response or survival between the two groups. Propantheline is an anticholinergic that causes xerostomia by decreasing salivation. Propantheline may reduce the salivary excretion of etoposide and could reduce its toxic effects on the mucosa. Propantheline is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients receiving high-dose etoposide.

AB  - Introduction. Marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) represent a heterogeneous group of indolent lymphomas arising from memory B lymphocytes within the marginal zone of the secondary lymphoid follicles. MZLs develop in spleen and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), rarely in lymph nodes. The updated WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms grouped MZLs in three specific subtypes: extranodal MZL (EMZL) or MALT type, splenic MZL (SMZL) and nodal MZL (NMZL). Due to the heterogeneity and rarity of these lymphomas, a risk stratified approach is currently lacking. Our study aims to identify whether integration of several clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters may correlate with the outcome of the different MZL subtypes. Materials and Methods. 19 patients (11 females and 8 males), aged between 38 to 84 years, with diagnosis of MZL, were evaluated. Histological subtypes were represented as follows: 12 patients (63.2%) with EMZL [site distribution: stomach (3), lung (3), parotid gland (3), orbit (2) and skin (1)]; 6 NMZL (31,6%) and 1 SMZL (5,2%). At the time of diagnosis, all patients underwent evaluation of basal parameters: clinical and pathology data (sex, age, stage, IPI, histological subtype, Ki67); blood count, LDH, b2-microglobulin and inflammatory markers (ESR, RCP, D-dimer and ferritin); morphological (ultrasound, CT or MRI) and functional (PET/CT) imaging scans (Table 1). PET/CT scans were performed in 15 out of 19 patients; FDG avidity expressed as SUV max was evaluated and included. In case of multiple lesions with different FDG avidity, the higher SUVmax in the patient was considered for statistical analysis. 15 out of 19 patients underwent standard treatments for MZL (steroids, antibiotics, immunotherapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery). At the end of treatment, reevaluation was performed in 12 of the 15 treated patients. The statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS package. Results. Due to the presence of only one SMZL patient in the whole group, we decided to exclude this subtype and to compare EMZL (12 patients) versus NMZL (6 patients) groups (Table 1). The analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of basal platelets count (147330 vs 259000 cells/mmc, NMZL vs EMZL respectively, p=0.018) and basal SUVmax (3.30 vs 8.28 NMZL vs EMZL respectively, p=0.040). Notably, we found lower ESR values in the NMZL group (6.60 mm/h) compared with the EMZL one (27.00 mm/h) without reaching statistic significance (p=0.100). All the other parameters evaluated did not show significant differences. Conclusions. We found a close correlation between EMZL subtype, level of platelet count and SUVmax. These data suggest that increased PET avidity may depend on marked systemic inflammatory stimuli triggered by EMZL rather than NMZL diseases. Further investigations with an enlarged cohort of patients will be needed to confirm these data and to design an integrated score for risk stratification of MZLs. (Table Presented).

AB  - Background: IT-Y90was approved in follicular lymphoma, and some data indicates that it could be used in DLBCL. It has been reported that early TEP-TDM negativity is associated with a longer survival in DLBCL, which suggest that these patients could benefit of a less intensive protocol. Method(s): We conducted an international, open-label, phase II non-randomised study, in patients aged between 65 and 80 with age-adjusted (aa) IPI score of 0 and 1 and CD20+ DLBCL. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 3 cycles of RCHOP14 followed by, in case of complete response (CR), an injection of IT-Y90. Result(s): Thirty patients (M/F= 1) were included. Median age was 72.6 years (range 65 - 80). Patients had a stage III/IV, elevated LDH and IPI=1 in 38%, 16.6 and 57% respectively. 25 patients received the full treatment. Five obtained an uncomplete FDG-PET response and were excluded after 2 RCHOP cycles. 23 patients received the full IT-Y90 dosage (0.4mCi/Kg) and two received the attenuated dosage (0.3mCi/Kg). Mean treatment time was 54 days (median 52; min 48-max 69). The CR rate after RCHOP treatment was 85% [95% CI: 65-94]. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Grade III-IV neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in 45% and 4%, respectively. Five patients experienced at least one febrile neutropenia. After IT-Y90, mean duration time for platelets <50G/l was 2.08 weeks (median 2; min 0-max 5). Two patients required platelet transfusion. With a median follow-up of 29.5 months [95% CI: 23-39], the estimated 3-year PFS was 90% [95% CI: 80-100] and the 3-year OS was 100% [95% CI: 100-100]. Among patients treated with 90Y-IT, only 3 relapsed were recorded (at 6, 16 and 24 months). Conclusion(s): this study suggested the feasibility, and efficacy of a short regimen including one injection of IT-Y90for selected DLBCL in complete response after 3 cycles of RCHOP14. This results need to be confirmed by further studies.     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 1.3686483522548445     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Karl S Peggs and Sarah J Albon contributed equally to the work and are joint first author Introduction Alemtuzumab reduces the incidence of GVHD after unrelated donor stem cell transplant (MUD SCT) but delays immune reconstitution resulting in high morbidity/mortality from viral infections. Previous studies have suggested that adoptive transfer of allodepleted donor T cells (ADTs) improves immunity after SCT but this has never been tested in a randomised study. We developed a methodology for selective immunomagnetic depletion of alloreactive T-cells upregulating CD25 and CD71 after activation with host dendritic cells (DC) and showed that ADTs retain anti-viral responses with minimal host alloreactivity (Samarasinghe et al Blood 2010). We have now tested whether ADTs can safely be used to improve immune reconstitution after MUD SCT for haematological malignancies in a randomised Phase II multi-centre clinical study; ICAT (NCT01827579). Methods Patients undergoing Alemtuzumab-based peripheral blood SCT from a 9/10 or 10/10 MUD for haematological malignancy were randomised 2:1 to receive either the ATIMP (ADTs) or standard of care. Two weeks prior to SCT, patients randomised to ATIMP underwent a leucapheresis from which DCs were generated. Irradiated patient-derived DCs were then co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from an unstimulated leucapheresis/500ml blood draw from the donor to activate alloreactive T cells. Four days later, the co-culture was depleted of CD25+ and CD71+ fractions by immunomagnetic depletion on the CliniMACs, sampled for residual alloreactivity and sterility, and cryopreserved. Patients randomised to the ATIMP were scheduled to receive 3 escalating doses of ADTs (0.1x106/Kg at day 30, 0.3x106/Kg at day 60 and 1x106/Kg at day 90 post-SCT) until either there was >grade 1 aGVHD or they had normal circulating T cells (>700/microL). The primary end-point of the study was circulating CD3+ T cell count at 4 months post-SCT with one-sided 15% significance level. Acute/chronic GVHD were graded using the Seattle/NIH criteria respectively. Results Twenty one patients were treated, 13 on the ATIMP arm and 8 on the control arm. The median age was 53 years and 67% (14) were male. 12 were AML/Myelodysplasia, 5 NHL, 3 CLL/CML and 1 HL. The median follow-up time is 14 months. Five of 13 ATIMP patients received 1 dose of ADTs, 4/13 2 doses and 4/13 all 3 doses. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was comparable between the arms. Overall, 7/13 ATIMP patients developed significant (>Grade 2) acute GVHD compared to 4/8 of the control arm (p>0.99). 3/13 patients in the ATIMP arm and 2/8 patients in the control arm developed severe aGVHD (all Grade 3). Three of 13 ATIMP cohort patients developed chronic GVHD (1 mild, 1 moderate, 1 severe), compared to 3/8 (all mild) in the control cohort. At 4 months, the circulating CD3+ T cell count mean was 730/microL (range 10-4080) in the ATIMP group and 212.5/microL (range 10-500) in the control group (1-sided p=0.11). However, the data was not normally distributed (Wilcoxon 1-sided p=0.18). Three ATIMP patients had high CD3+ T cell count at 4 months (>1000/microL). At 6 months, the mean circulating CD3+ T cell count was 833.6/microL (range 20-2690) and 327.5/microL (range 10-860). At month 4, the mean PHA stimulation index in the ATIMP arm was 16.8 (range 0.67- 73.1) vs 3.8 (range 1.1-8.2) in the control group. At 4 and 6 months post-SCT, spectratyping analysis showed no evidence of a difference in Vbeta diversity between the 2 arms in both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The 1-year survival rate in the ATIMP cohort is 92% vs 88% in the control, and 1-year disease free survival rate 67% in the ATIMP cohort vs 70% in the control. Conclusions These data suggest that adoptive transfer of ADTs improves T cell reconstitution in some patients after MUD SCT and that the GVHD rates were similar between ATIMP and control groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hu5F9-G4 (hereafter, 5F9) antibody is a macrophage immune checkpoint inhibitor blocking CD47 that induces tumor-cell phagocytosis. 5F9 synergizes with rituximab to eliminate B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells by enhancing macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. This combination was evaluated clinically. METHOD(S): We conducted a phase 1b study involving patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients may have had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma. 5F9 (at a priming dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously, with weekly maintenance doses of 10 to 30 mg per kilogram) was given with rituximab to determine safety and efficacy and to suggest a phase 2 dose. RESULT(S): A total of 22 patients (15 with DLBCL and 7 with follicular lymphoma) were enrolled. Patients had received a median of 4 (range, 2 to 10) previous therapies, and 95% of the patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were anemia and infusion-related reactions. Anemia (an expected on-target effect) was mitigated by the strategy of 5F9 prime and maintenance dosing. Dose-limiting side effects were rare. A selected phase 2 dose of 30 mg of 5F9 per kilogram led to an approximate 100% CD47-receptor occupancy on circulating white and red cells. A total of 50% of the patients had an objective (i.e., complete or partial) response, with 36% having a complete response. The rates of objective response and complete response were 40% and 33%, respectively, among patients with DLBCL and 71% and 43%, respectively, among those with follicular lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months among patients with DLBCL and 8.1 months among those with follicular lymphoma, 91% of the responses were ongoing. CONCLUSION(S): The macrophage checkpoint inhibitor 5F9 combined with rituximab showed promising activity in patients with aggressive and indolent lymphoma. No clinically significant safety events were observed in this initial study.Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB  - Follicular lymphoma can be dividedin to three main subgroups: localised, advanced stageasymptomatic and advanced stage symptomaticdisease. There is as yet no evidence that chemotherapyor immunochemotherapy prolongs the life of patientsin the first two categories; the first is still best treatedwith local radiation with no evidence of any benefitfor additional therapy and the second by observationuntil symptomatic progression, although there are anumber of studies suggesting a delay in the need forchemotherapy by the use of monoclonal antibodiesthere is no conclusive evidence of long term benefitor prolongation of survival by early intervention. Inpatients with advanced stage symptomatic disease, orthose who in clinical trials fulfil the establishedGELF or BNLI criteria for therapy, progression freesurvival (PFS) has been significantly prolonged bythe use of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab incombination with chemotherapy either CVP CHOPor Bendamustine, with Fludarabine based regimensfalling out of favour as a consequence of concernsabout long term marrow toxicity and opportunisticinfection. Although anthracycline based regimensmay yield superior results to CVP, a large scale randomised study demonstrated that the combination ofBendamustine with Rituximab produced longer progression free survival than R-CHOP and this combination has now become standard of care (SOC) inmost European centres with a PFS over 5 years.Additional benefit may be observed with the use ofRituximab maintenance therapy after induction,albeit with different induction regimens, prolongingthe median duration of first remission to over 7 years, with the best results seen in those patients with anegative PET scan after the conclusion of inductionchemotherapy It is against this background that anynon chemotherapy based therapy will need to bejudged. Long term follow up data on the use ofsingle agent Rituximab as first line therapy with 2year maintenance therapy may be associated with prolonged PFS with a small cohort of patients remainingdisease free for up to 8 years, but the majority of thesepatients had a low tumour burden and the time ofdiagnosis with no immediate clinical requirement forchemotherapy More promising are the data on thecombination of the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide in combination with Rituximab, one retrospective analysis from MDACC showing anequivalent PFS with the R2 regimen compared to multiagent chemotherapy, and a prospective phase II trialfrom the same institution showing high response rateswith this chemotherapy free regimen, but as Buskepoints out in an accompanying editorial "Rituximabplus chemotherapy combinations are uniformlyaccepted as standard treatment for follicular lymphoma, underlining that we are still dependent on achemotherapy backbone if we want to offer patientswith follicular lymphoma the most effective treatmentpossible". A similar prospective study from the SAKKgroup shows a high response to this combination butno long term PFS data are yet available There arenow limited data from small phase II trials whereRituximab is combined with the bcl2 inhibitor "venetoclax" or the PI3kinase inhibitor Idelalisib, but thereare no definitive results that would enable us to conclude that we can yet discard chemotherapy fromfirst line treatment for Follicular lymphoma We alsohave to remember that even if impressive data are published in the near future, cost, toxicity and the sideeffects of long term usage of novel agents have to beset against the considerable achievements possiblewith short course non toxic chemo-immunotherapy.

AB  - Radio-immunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) has been first approved in 2004 as a treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma (FL). In April 2008, the label has been extended to the consolidation therapy after remission induction in previously untreated patients with FL on the basis of the First-line indolent trial (FIT) phase III randomised study of Zevalin as front-line consolidation versus no further treatment. Consolidation of first remission with Zevalin (15 MBq/kg), 6 to 12 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose in advanced-stage FL is highly effective with no unexpected toxicities, prolonging PFS by 2 years and resulting in 77% PR-to-CR conversion rates regardless of type of first-line induction treatment. An assessment of the dosimetry of 90-Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in the FIT study indicated that consolidation treatment was safe in all patients, including those with a CR after induction therapy. The consolidation strategy with Zevalin, as a single agent or combined with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is currently investigated in other types of B-cell lymphomas. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Introduction The availability of HLA matched donors remains a major obstacle for successful allogeneic hematotopoietic cell transplantation. The use of HLA-mismatched alternate donors such as cord blood and haploidentical donor stem cell sources have allowed for greater access for those patients who need an allo-HSCT but lack a suitable matched sibling or unrelated donor. Introduction of high dose cytoxan in the early post-transplant period has significantly improved the outcomes of patients undergoing haploidentical transplantation and has eliminated the need for expensive and labor-intensive ex-vivo T cell depletion. Encouraging results have been reported using this platform with bone marrow as the source of stem cells. However, there have been only limited reports using this transplant platform with G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a source of stem cells for haloidentical transplantation. Here we report the outcomes of 18 patients who underwent haploidentical transplant for hematological malignancies from single institution treated on the Hopkins non-meloablative conditioning regimen but with G-CSF mobilized PBSC as a source of stem cells from a haplo-identical family donor. Patients and Methods A total of 18 patients (median age 41 years, range 22-73 years, 11 males and 7 females) between July 2009 and June 2013 underwent haploidentical transplant at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis using the Hopkins non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with post transplant cytoxan (fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day on days -6 to -2), cytoxan (14.5 mg/kg/day on days -6 and -5) and TBI (single dose at 200cGy on day -1) and all these patients received two doses of post-transplant cytoxan (50mg/kg on D+3 and D+4). G-CSF mobilized PBSC from parents (n=9) or siblings (9) were used as a graft source with median CD34+ cell dose of 5.0 x 106/kg and median CD3+ T cell dose of 19.7 x 107/kg. GVHD prophylaxis regimen included MMF plus tacrolimus (16/18 patients) or MTX plus tacrolimus (2/18 patients). Median follow-up of all patients was 251 (range 17-1174) days. Diagnoses included AML (n=12), ALL (n=2), NHL (n=2), CLL (n=1) and aplastic anemia (n=1). 7 out of 12 AML patients underwent transplant with active disease (not in remission) and 4/18 of these patients had prior history of allogeneic HCT. Results 16 patients (89%) engrafted (> 95% donor chimerism), median time to neutrophil engraftment was 15 days (range: 12-28 days) and median time to platelet engraftment was 18 days (range: 11-40 days). None of these patients had secondary graft failure. 1-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 62% and 100-day and 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were 11% and 17% respectively. Both 1-year and 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) rates were 53%. Despite very high CD3+ T cell doses, cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 40.7% while grade III-IV aGvHD occurred in only 3 patients (17%). Cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 2 years were both at 8% (extensive in only 1 patient). CMV reactivation occurred in 11 patients (61%) but did not significantly impact their survival or relapse rates and none of these patients developed CMV disease. Conclusions Here we report the outcomes of 18 patients with hematologic malignancies or marrow failure states undergoing haploidentical transplant using the published Hopkins NMA conditioning platform with post-transplant high dose cytoxan and with G-CSF mobilized PBSC as a source of donor stem cells. In spite of the limited numbers of patients transplanted, our results suggest that this approach is both safe and effective and associated with rapid multilineage engraftment, low rates of both aGvHD and cGvHD and encouraging overall and disease-free survival rates and low rates of NRM. Based on these results, 1) G-CSF mobilized PBSC from haploidentical donors should be considered as an alternative source of haploidentical stem cells to BM and 2) future randomized trials using this platform to test the role of haploidential G-CSF mobilized PBSC with other unrelated donor stem cell sources (cord blood and matched unrelated could also be considered in the future. (Figure presented) Over all survival (OS) rates in patients after haploidentical transplantation, with red dotted line showing OS in patients who were in remission at the time of the transplant while the and blue line represents patients with active disease at the time of their transplant.

AB  - Background: Effective DLBCL adjuvant therapy after first-line chemotherapy is needed as high-risk DLBCL is associated with a poor 4-year overall survival (OS) rate (Sehn et al, Blood 2007;109:1857-61). In a phase II study of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in relapsed, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL patients (n=47) had a 30% overall response rate (Witzig et al, Leukemia 2011;25:341-7). Method(s): PILLAR-2 is an ongoing international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study designed to compare everolimus efficacy and safety with that of placebo in poor-risk DLBCL patients who achieved complete response (CR) with first-line rituximab-based chemotherapy (R-chemo) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00790036 ; sponsor: Novartis Pharmaceuticals). Eligibility criteria include age 18 years; confirmed stage II bulky, III, or IV DLBCL and International Prognostic Index 3-5 at diagnosis; confirmed CR per revised International Workshop Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al, J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579-86) after first-line R-chemo regimen completed 6-14 weeks before study drug start; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2; no ongoing or post-R-chemo radiation; and no myelosuppressive chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 3 weeks. Patients are randomized 1:1 to everolimus 10 mg once daily or matching placebo and treated for 12 months or until disease relapse, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Radiologic tumor assessment is performed at baseline, every 12 weeks during years 1 and 2, every 24 weeks during years 3 and 4, and annually thereafter until start of new anticancer therapy or 5 years after last patient randomization. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints are OS, lymphoma-specific survival, and safety. Expected enrollment is 687 patients. Final analysis will be performed when 279 DFS events occur; survival follow-up will continue until 338 deaths occur and the last randomized patient has been followed for 5 years. Currently, 422 patients are enrolled. The data monitoring committee last reviewed the trial in July 2011 and recommended that it continue as planned.

AB  - Antigenics is developing a therapeutic cancer vaccine based on heat-shock proteins (HSPs). The vaccine [HSPPC-96, Oncophage] is in a pivotal phase III clinical trial for renal cancer at 80 clinical sites worldwide. The trial is enrolling at least 500 patients who are randomised to receive surgical removal of the primary tumour followed by out-patient treatment with Oncophage((R)) or surgery only. This study was initiated on the basis of results from a pilot phase I/II study and preliminary results from a phase II study in patients with renal cell cancer. In October 2001, Oncophage was designated as a fast-track product by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Oncophage is in phase I/II trials in Italy for colorectal cancer (30 patients) and melanoma. The trials in Italy are being conducted at the Istituto dei Tumouri, Milan (in association with Sigma-Tau). Preliminary data from the phase II trial for melanoma was presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in Florida, USA, in October 2001. Oncophage is also in a phase I/II (42 patients) and a phase II trial (84 patients) in the US for renal cell cancer, a phase II trial in the US for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (35 patients), a phase II trial in the US for sarcoma (20-35 patients), a phase I/II trial in the US for melanoma (36 patients), and phase I/II trials in Germany for gastric (30 patients) and pancreatic cancers. A pilot phase I trial in patients with pancreatic cancer began in the US in 1997 with 5 patients enrolled. In November 2000, Antigenics announced that this trial had been expanded to a phase I/II study which would now include survival as an endpoint and would enroll 5 additional patients. The US trials are being performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The trials in Germany are being carried out at Johannes Gutenberg-University Hospital, Mainz. Oncophage is an autologous vaccine consisting of purified complexes of tumour-derived HSPs linked to tumour antigen peptides. When these HSPPC are readministered to a patient following surgery or biopsy of the tumour, the antigenic tumour peptides are expressed on the surface of potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. This stimulates a much more powerful anti-tumour immune response than that generated by expression of the same antigens by the tumour cell. Thus, Antigenics autologous HSP technology is attractive because it is highly specific for individual patients and circumvents the need for identification of specific antigens for individual cancers (i.e. it does not require definition of the antigenic epitopes on cancer cells) and it overcomes the immune tolerance associated with various tumours. Oncophage is manufactured in a 10-hour process from surgically resected autologous tumour. A minimum of 1-3g of tumour tissue is required to produce enough Oncophage for a course of treatment. The major limiting factor for producing Oncophage from a particular cancer is the ability to purify HSP from that cancer. From clinical studies to date, Antigenics has been able to produce HSP from 100, 98, 90, 71 and 30% of colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer tumours, respectively. The low success rate with pancreatic cancers is because of the high concentration of proteases in that tissue type. HSPs are a family of highly conserved proteins present in the cells of all organisms. They function as molecular chaperones, assisting the correct folding of polypeptides and aiding intracellular protein transport. In addition, HSPs associate with a broad range of peptides derived from intracellular protein degradation, including antigenic peptides produced in tumour cells. Antigenics has exclusively licensed worldwide rights to its HSP immunotherapeutic complexes from Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Fordham University in the USA. On 3 November 1998, Antigenics was issued a US patent (5,830,464) covering immunotherapy in which antigen-presenting cells are isolated and mixed with heat shock protein-antigen complexes purified from patients' tumours. The patent was issued to Fordham University, New York, US, who subsequently licensed it to Antigenics. Antigenics has an agreement with Sigma Tau, under the terms of which the latter company will fund 2 clinical trials in return for an option to market Oncophage in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Antigenics also has an agreement with Medison for marketing of Oncophage in Israel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-transplantation (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-negativity is one of the strongest predictors of outcome after high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and activity of PET-adapted salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin, followed by augmented ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). METHODS: In this non-randomised, open-label, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who had failed one previous doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen. All patients received weekly infusions of 1·2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin on days 1, 8, and 15 for two 28 day cycles. After completion of brentuximab vedotin treatment, patients received a PET scan. Patients who achieved PET-negative status (a Deauville score of 1 or 2) proceeded directly to HDT/ASCT; those with persistent abnormalities on PET received two cycles of augmented ICE (augICE; two doses of ifosfamide 5000 mg/m(2) in combination with mesna 5000 mg/m(2) continuous infusion over 24 h, days 1 and 2; one dose of carboplatin AUC 5, day 3; three doses of etoposide 200 mg/m(2) every 12 h, day 1) before consideration for HDT/ASCT. Only patients with persistent abnormalities on PET after brentuximab vedotin received augICE; however, all patients in the intention-to-treat population were assessed for the primary outcome, which was the proportion of patients who were PET-negative after brentuximab vedotin alone or brentuximab vedotin followed by augICE. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01508312, and is no longer accruing patients. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2012, and Oct 4, 2013, we enrolled 46 patients. One patient was deemed ineligible, and not evaluable, before treatment initiation owing to having nodular, lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma and thus 45 patients received treatment. After brentuximab vedotin, 12 patients (27%, 95% CI 13-40) were PET-negative and proceeded to HDT/ASCT. 33 (73%, 95% CI 60-86) patients were PET-positive after brentuximab vedotin; one PET-positive patient withdrew consent, therefore 32 PET-positive patients received augICE, 22 (69%, 95% CI 53-85) of whom were PET-negative. Overall, 34 patients (76%, 95% CI 62-89) achieved PET-negativity. All 44 patients who completed treatment as per protocol proceeded to receive HDT/ASCT. Brentuximab vedotin was well tolerated and associated with few grade 3-4 adverse events including hyperglycaemia (two [4%] patients, grade 3), nausea (one [2%], grade 3), hypoglycaemia (one [2%], grade 3 and one [2%], grade 4), and hypocalcaemia (one [2%], grade 3 and one [2%], grade 4). INTERPRETATION: PET-adapted sequential salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin followed by augICE resulted in a high proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma achieving PET-negativity, and therefore could optimise the chance of cure after HDT/ASCT.

AB  - Combined direct antineoplastic activity and the long-lasting immunological effects of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure many hematological malignancies, but broad adoption requires non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) control. Recently, posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) given after a bone marrow transplant significantly reduced GVHD-incidence, while PTCy given with tacrolimus/mofetil mycophenolate (T/MMF) showed activity following allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPB-SCT). Here, we report the experience of a larger cohort (85 consecutive patients) and expanded follow-up period (03/2011-12/2019) with high-risk hematological malignancies who received alloPB-SCT from Human-Leukocyte-Antigens HLA-matched unrelated/related donors. GVHD-prophylaxis was PTCy 50 mg/kg (days+3 and +4) combined with T/MMF (day+5 forward). All patients stopped MMF on day+28 with day+110 = median tacrolimus discontinuation. Cumulative incidences were 12% for acute and 7% for chronic GVHD-and no GVHD-attributed deaths. For surviving patients, the 12, 24, and 36-month probabilities of being off immunosuppression were 92, 96, and 96%, respectively. After a 36-month median follow-up, NRM was 4%; median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) had yet to occur. One-and two-year chronic GVHD-EFS results were 57% (95% CI, 46-68%) and 53% (95% CI, 45-61%), respectively, with limited late infections and long-term organ toxicities. Disease relapse caused the most treatment failures (38% at 2 years), but low transplant toxicity allowed many patients (14/37, 38%) to receive donor lymphocyte infusions as a post-relapse strategy. We confirmed that PTCy+T/MMF treatment effectively prevented acute and chronic GVHD and limited NRM to unprecedented low rates without loss of disease control efficacy in an expanded patient cohort.
