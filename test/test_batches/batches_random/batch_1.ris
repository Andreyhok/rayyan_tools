AB  - Background. Autologous transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) results in faster haematopoietic-cell repopulation than with bone marrow. We prospectively compared bone marrow and PBSC for allogeneic transplantation. Methods. Adult HLA-identical sibling donors provided bone marrow and lenograstim-mobilised PBSC. 39 patients with malignant haematological disorders were infused with either bone marrow (n = 19) or PBSC (n = 20) after standard conditioning regimens in a double-blind, randomised fashion. The identity of the infused products for all patients remained masked until 1 year after the last patient had received transplantation. Findings. The PBSC group had significantly faster neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 109/L (median 17.5 vs 23 days, p = 0.002), and platelet recovery to 20 x 109/L (median 11 vs 18 days, p < 0.0001) and to 50 x 109/L (median 20.5 vs 27 days, p = 0.02) than the bone-marrow group. PBS0 patients were discharged from hospital earlier than were bone-marrow patients (median 26 vs 31 days, p = 0.01). At 4 weeks after transplantation, absolute lymphocytes (0.48 vs 0.63, p = 0.08) and CD25 cells (0.04 vs 0.08, p = 0.007) were higher in the PBSC group, and the proportion of patients with absolute lymphopenia (74% vs 33%, p = 0.03) and CD4 lymphopenia (59% vs 24%, p = 0.05) was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of acute or chronic graft-versus host disease and overall survival. The probability of relapse was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group than in the PBSC group (p = 0.01); all five relapses occurred among bone-marrow recipients. Interpretation. Our small study indicates that PBSCs are better than bone marrow for allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical siblings in terms of faster haematopoietic and immune recovery, and have the potential to reduce disease recurrence.

AB  - MABCUTE (NCT01461928) is an ongoing multicentre, phase IIIb study evaluating subcutaneous (SC) rituximab maintenance in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Adult patients with histologically-confirmed relapsed/refractory CD20 + iNHL and >=1 line of immunotherapy +/-chemotherapy +/-radiotherapy, plus a CR/PR to induction (rituximab every 3- 4 weeks x8 cycles [IV 375 mg/m2 c1, SC 1400 mg, c2-8]) and 6-8 cycles' standard chemotherapy followed by standard maintenance (rituximab SC 1400 mg/8 weeks for 24 months), were randomised to further maintenance rituximab (SC 1400 mg/8 weeks) until PD, or observation. At January 16, 2013, the safety population comprised 216 patients with >=1 dose SC rituximab: 70 (32%) had completed induction (24 [11%] discontinued), 58 (27%) had entered standard maintenance (2 discontinued), and the remainder were mid-induction. Median age was 64.5 years (range 20-90). Most patients had follicular NHL (n = 131 [61%]) and the most common chemotherapy regimen was bendamustine (n = 137 [63%]). Administration-related reactions (ARRs) occurred in 61 (28%) patients after 1 dose of rituximab IV and 89 (41%) patients after a median (range) 5 (1-11) doses of rituximab SC. Most common AEs were neutropenia (n = 44 [20%]), nausea (n = 41 [19%]) and pyrexia (n = 35 [16%]). Grade >=3 AEs occurred in 70 patients (32%). SAEs occurred in 44 patients (20%). Grade 4 haematological events (n = 25 [12%]) were mostly neutropenia (n = 22 [10%]). One non-haematological grade 4 event (thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) resolved after 12 days. Reasons for discontinuation (n = 26): AEs (n = 8), patient/investigator request (n = 6), PD (n = 5), death (n = 2), other (n = 5). There were two deaths; neither was considered study drug-related. Rituximab SC is associated with transient and mainly mild/moderate ARRs which were expected given the change in administration route; other toxicities were of expected incidence and intensity with no new safety signals identified, as confirmed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Rituximab SC appears to be well tolerated and the study continues.

AB  - Risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation was assessed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients with resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive) who received obinutuzumab- or rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy in the phase 3 GOYA and GALLIUM studies. HBV DNA monitoring was undertaken monthly to 1 year after the last dose of study drug. In case of HBV reactivation (confirmed, HBV DNA ++29 IU/mL), immunochemotherapy was withheld and nucleos(t)ide analog treatment (preemptive NAT) started. Immunochemotherapy was restarted if HBV DNA became undetectable or reactivation was not confirmed, and discontinued if HBV DNA exceeded 100 IU/mL on NAT. Prophylactic NAT was allowed by investigator discretion. Among 326 patients with resolved HBV infection, 27 (8.2%) had HBV reactivation, occurring a median of 125 days (interquartile range, 85-331 days) after the first dose. In 232 patients without prophylactic NAT, 25 (10.8%) had HBV reactivation; all received preemptive NAT. Ninety-four patients received prophylactic NAT; 2 (2.1%) had HBV reactivation. No patients developed HBV-related hepatitis. On multivariate Cox analysis, detectable HBV DNA at baseline was strongly associated with an increased risk of reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.04-54.93; P < .0001). Prophylactic NAT was strongly associated with a reduced risk (adjusted HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41; P 5 .0018). HBV DNA monitoring-guided preemptive NAT was effective in preventing HBV-related hepatitis during anti-CD20-containing immunochemotherapy in B-cell NHL patients with resolved HBV infection. Antiviral prophylaxis was also effective and may be appropriate for high-risk patients. These trials were registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01287741 (GOYA) and NCT01332968 (GALLIUM).Copyright © 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - Background: Initial results from the ongoing GALLIUM trial have shown that patients with follicular lymphoma have a longer progression-free survival after first-line immunochemotherapy with obinutuzumab than with rituximab. The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the prognostic value of PET-CT responses after first-line immunochemotherapy in the GALLIUM study. Method(s): GALLIUM is an open-label, parallel-group randomised, phase 3 trial, which recruited previously untreated patients with CD20-positive follicular lymphoma (grades 1-3a; disease stage III/IV, or stage II with largest tumour diameter >=7 cm) who were aged 18 years or older and met the criteria for needing treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous administration of obinutuzumab (1000 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of subsequent cycles) or rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle), in six 21-day cycles with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (known as CHOP; oral administration) followed by two 21-day cycles of antibody alone, or eight 21-day cycles cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (known as CVP; oral administration), or six 28-day cycles with bendamustine, followed by maintenance antibody every 2 months for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint of the trial, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, has been reported previously. This secondary analysis reports PET and CT-based responses at end-of-induction therapy and explains their relation with progression-free and overall survival outcomes in patients with available scans. As per protocol, during the trial, PET scans (mandatory in the first 170 patients enrolled at sites with available PET facilities, and optional thereafter), acquired at baseline and end of induction (PET population), were assessed prospectively by investigators and an independent review committee (IRC) applying International Harmonisation Project (IHP) 2007 response criteria, and retrospectively by the IRC only applying current Lugano 2014 response criteria. IRC members (but not study investigators) were masked to treatment and clinical outcome when assessing response. The landmark analyses excluded patients who died or progressed (contrast enhanced CT-based assessment of progressive disease, or started next anti-lymphoma treatment) before or at end of induction. GALLIUM is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01332968. Finding(s): 1202 patients were enrolled in GALLIUM between July 6, 2011, and Feb 4, 2014, of whom 595 were included in the PET population; 533 (IHP 2007; prospective analysis), and 508 (Lugano 2014; retrospective analysis) were analysed for progression-free survival (landmark analysis). At end of induction, 390 of 595 patients (65.5% [95% CI 61.6-69.4]) achieved PET complete response according to IHP 2007 criteria, and 450 (75.6% [95% CI 72.0-79.0]) obtained PET complete metabolic response according to Lugano 2014 criteria. With a median of 43.3 months of observation (IQR 36.2-51.8), 2.5-year progression-free survival from end of induction was 87.8% (95% CI 83.9-90.8) in PET complete responders and 72.0% (63.1-79.0) in non-complete responders according to IRC-assessed IHP 2007 criteria (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6, p<0.0001). According to Lugano 2014 criteria, 2.5-year progression-free survival in complete metabolic responders was 87.4% (95% CI 83.7-90.2) and in non-complete metabolic responders was 54.9% (40.5-67.3; HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.3, p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Our results suggest that PET is a better imaging modality than contrast-enhanced CT for response assessment after first-line immunochemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma. PET assessment according to Lugano 2014 response criteria provides a platform for investigation of response-adapted therapeutic approaches. Additional supportive data are welcomed.

AB  - Background: Over 12,000 new cases of B-cell malignancies are diagnosed in the UK each year, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) being the most common subtypes. Standard frontline therapy consists of immunochemotherapy with a CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), such as rituximab, delivered in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Despite being considered a treatable and potentially curable cancer, approximately 30% of DLBCL cases will relapse after frontline therapy. Advanced stage FL is incurable and typically has a relapsing and remitting course with a frequent need for re-treatment. Based on supportive preclinical data, we hypothesised that the addition of varlilumab (an anti-CD27 mAb) to rituximab (an anti-CD20 mAb) can improve the rate, depth and duration of the response of rituximab monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Methods/design: Combination treatment of varlilumab plus rituximab, in two different dosing regimens, is being tested in the RIVA trial. RIVA is a two-stage open-label randomised phase IIa design in up to 40 patients with low- or high-grade relapsed or refractory CD20+ B-cell lymphoma. The study is open to recruitment in the UK. Enrolled patients are randomised 1:1 to two different experimental varlilumab to rituximab combinations. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination and the anti-tumour activity (response) in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Secondary objectives will include an evaluation of the duration of the response and overall survival. Tertiary translational objectives include assessment of B-cell depletion, changes in immune effector cell populations, expression of CD27 as a biomarker of response and pharmacokinetic properties. Analyses will not be powered for formal statistical comparisons between treatment arms. Discussion(s): RIVA will determine whether the combination of rituximab and varlilumab in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies is active and safe prior to future phase II/III trials.

AB  - High-intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is an aggressive form of the disease, which can respond well to combination chemotherapy, with long-term survival seen in 40-50% of patients. When NHL relapses following standard treatment, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow support may still cure a significant proportion of patients. Despite a significant rise in the incidence of NHL over recent years, there remains only limited published economic study concerning the overall lifetime cost of treatment, the cost effectiveness of specific treatments or the overall societal cost burden of the disease. The majority of studies identified for the purposes of this review considered the cost of alternative forms of chemotherapy and bone marrow support strategies for patients with advanced disease. Data from these studies suggest that there is a definite trend towards reduced costs for high-dose therapy, possibly reflecting increasing technical experience and improved bone marrow recovery through the use of stem cell transplantation and growth factors. The limited number of cost-effectiveness evaluations suggest that high-dose therapy, following a chemosensitive relapse, is likely to be considered favourable against commonly quoted cost-effectiveness thresholds. Cost effectiveness is becoming an increasingly important factor to consider in the formal assessment of new interventions conducted by groups such as the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence. In light of the increasing incidence of NHL and the extended use of high-dose treatments in other subgroups of patients, there is a need for increased research into the economics of new interventions for NHL.

AB  - The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (in particular rituximab) in the treatment algorithm of follicular lymphoma has signiicantly improved the median survival of this disease. Nevertheless, with the exception of a few special cases, it remains an incurable disease. A number of questions remain open and we are going to discuss three of them: Is watch and wait still an option? Is R-CHOP the standard first-line treatment? What is the role of autologous and allogeneic transplantation? The attitude of watching and waiting is regularly challenged because of concerns that delaying treatment could cause irreversible organ damage, permit the general condition of the patient to reduce, allow the appearance of chemotherapy resistant clones or transformation to high-grade lymphoma. Studies and experience conirm that, due to the usually slow progression of the disease, if a strict policy of regular follow- up visits is in place, organ damage and performance status reductions are readily recognized and dealt with. Studies also show that resistance to chemotherapy is not dependent on stage and inally transformation to high-grade is independent from the timing of first-line treatment. The 4 randomised studies performed in the last 2 decades confirmed that watch and wait does not confer a worse survival compared to immediate initial treatment. The very good partial and complete response rates and response duration seen with aggressive irst-line treatment, as CHOP combined with rituximab, has prompted some cooperative groups and centers to elect this regimen as a standard irst-line. Nevertheless, many studies have shown in the past that increased response rate and duration do not translate into prolonged survival. This is still true today and the comparison of many studies with different kinds of protocols, ranging from single agent chemo- or immunotherapy to very complex and aggressive combination treatments all show in the long term (as 7 years follow- up) similar progression free survival rates. In addition, the recent demonstration that the combination of rituximab and single agent bendamustine is better tolerated and as active as R-CHOP will further question the primate of R-CHOP as irst- line treatment. Several randomised trials are still ongoing to clarify which irst-line treatment, if any, is optimal for follicular lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation proved to be a good salvage treatment for patients in irst or second relapse. According to one small randomised and a few historical studies, this strategy could prolong survival compared to standard salvage chemo- immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in irst-line, four randomised studies show no advantage for this strategy. It is probable that the secondary MDS/AML and the acute toxicities could jeopardise the minimal survival advantage. On the other hand allogeneic transplantation is probably the sole modality with curative potential in this disease. Nevertheless, it is bound to very important acute toxicity, translating in almost 50% early deaths in the fist year after transplantation. Because of this, despite of the curative potential, this modality is kept for patients with early aggressive relapse, who are young and it enough to tolerate the treatment. In conclusion the treatment algorithm for irst-line follicular lymphoma should consider prognostic factors, symptoms and patient subjective priority to choose among watch and wait, intensive treatment or a milder treatment with single agents.

AB  - Thirteen patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma were treated with 131I-Lym-1 during the course of a dose escalation trial. Principal aims were to establish the maximum tolerated single dose (MTD), as well as to assess clinical and dosimetric effects of the MTD. Patients were eligible if >25% of tumor cells bound Lym-1 on immunohistochemistry, stain intensity was +2/4 or greater and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) assay was negative. Radioimmunotherapy was performed with escalating doses at levels of 50 mCi, 65 mCi/m2 and 80 mCi/m2 (50-139 mCi total). Patients were eligible for retreatment after 6-10 weeks if there was no severe toxicity, their disease was at least stable and HAMA remained negative. Three were retreated. Four have achieved partial responses which lasted 11, 11, 18 and 22 weeks. Acute toxicities included rigors (69%), fever (62%), nausea (46%), vomiting (46%), pruritus (23%), urticaria (23%), chest pain (23%) and bronchospasm (15%). HAMA developed in 3 patients. Myelosuppression, manifested as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, was dose-limiting and defined the single dose MTD at 65 mCi/m2. Plasma radioactivity clearance was biphasic, with a 0.9 hr alpha-T( 1/2 ) and a 19.8 hr beta-T( 1/2 ). At completion of Lym-1 infusion, a mean of 45% of the injected dose was recoverable in the circulation. Images obtained within the first 2 hours indicated mean hepatic and splenic uptake was 29% and 11%, respectively. Radiation absorbed doses to tumor ranged from 18-61 rads; mean doses to whole body ranged from 17 to 71 rads.

AB  - Current guidelines for SARS‐CoV2 vaccination in immunosuppressed populations are based on limited evidence. Additionally, guidelines for the use of SARS‐CoV2 vaccines in autoimmune populations are somewhat contradictory, with the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations including advice to where possible administer booster vaccinations prior to commencing immunosuppression but to preferably vaccinate while the autoimmune disease is not active. In haematological conditions it is suggested that vaccination occur prior to B cell depletion therapies e.g. rituximab, or >6 months after its use. While these guidelines were developed for non‐live vaccines in general, the evidence for COVID‐19 vaccines is almost entirely based on expert opinion. Clearly, with these gaps and inconsistencies in the clinical guidelines there is equipoise for the optimal timing of a booster vaccination. One of the difficulties in this field is the wide diversity of patients receiving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. We have therefore taken a pragmatic 'real‐world' approach in our design by focusing on two broad patient groups that are more specifically stratify based on pre‐define disease conditions and specific treatments. Recent data studying COVID‐19 vaccine responses in patients on immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune/inflammatory conditions demonstrate the greatest compromise in anti‐Spike IgG occurs in those receiving combination immunosuppression particularly regimens that include methotrexate and other antimetabolites, and B cell depleting therapies. In patients with haematological malignancies the lowest vaccine responses were seen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In patients with a haematological malignancy who have undergone a bone marrow transplant, immunisation to COVID‐19 <6 months following transplantation resulted in poor IgG response to vaccine, while those immunised >6 months post‐transplant had superior responses. In contrast, other targeted therapies including the integrin inhibitor vedoluzimab or anti IL‐17/23 therapy (in the absence of concurrent methotrexate) have relatively preserved response to the initial vaccine regimen. Given the available data, we propose to study defined populations of two major immunosuppressed patient groups: Group 1): Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) and Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease, and Group 2: Autologous and Allogeneic Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. We will compare the difference between an immediate COVID‐19 "booster" dose and a deferred COVID‐19 "booster". In Group 1 "Immediate" is defined as prior to the commencement of moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression and "Deferred" is defined as 6 months post commencement of moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression. For Group 2 BMT patients, current national guidelines recommend 3 doses of pre‐BMT COVID‐19 vaccines followed by 3 doses of post‐BMT COVID‐19 vaccines initiated 6 months post‐BMT. In Group 2 "Immediate" is defined as 6 months post‐BMT and "Deferred" as >12 months post‐BMT. The primary end‐point will be the integrated area under the curve (AUC) of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity over the first year of immunosuppression. At present the level of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 is the most robust correlate of protection against COVID‐19. In both study Groups the comparator of a delayed boost at 6 months is based on the premise of maximising peak NAb responses by administering the booster after induction therapy is completed. Such a delay must be weighed against the risk of reduced immunity and breakthrough COVID‐19 infection during this period. Such a risk will be monitored closely during the study with scheduled interim safety analyses and reviews by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Participants in Group 1 will also receive a single diphtheria/tetanus (dT) toxoid booster as a comparator vaccine with the aim of determining whether the results of the optimal timing of the COVID‐19 booster also apply to more traditional protein vaccines. If this is found to be the case, the results of this study may have broader implications for the vaccinology field and optimal clinical guidelines. Primary Objective: to determine the anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 NAb response over 12 months from a booster with a mRNA SARS‐CoV2 vaccine over 12 months in a population who; Group 1: are commencing moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression for treatment of either a haematological malignancy (excluding BMT patients) or an autoimmune/inflammatory condition and are previously fully‐immunised (i.e. had received 3 or more doses of BNT162b2, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Novovax vaccine including combinations) or, Group 2: have recently undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy and have previously received 3 post‐BMT doses of BNT162b2, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Novovax vaccine including combinations. We will determine the difference between the booster being administered as follows: Group 1: immediately prior to starting moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression or at 6 months after therapy start, by monitoring the relative sustained immunogenicity over 1 year. Group 2: immediately at 6‐months post‐BMT or deferred until >12 months post‐BMT. Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess a range of secondary immunological end‐points including: 1. . To quantitate antibodies to tetanus toxoid integrated over the 12‐month period post‐randomisation. 2. . To assess the safety and efficacy of the two approaches (immediate or deferred vaccination) including any indication of vaccine‐induced disease flares and any breakthrough infections with SARS‐CoV‐2. 3. . To analyse the response to the SARS‐CoV2 vaccine including: i. Breadth of NAb against the SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern (VOC) ii. The kinetics of neutralizing antibody over time including responses to VOC iii. Memory T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses to peptide sets representing different domains of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein 2. To assess these responses in populations stratified by broad disease type (i.e. haematological malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients), autoimmune/inflammatory disease or haematological malignancy post‐BMT and different modes of immunosuppression e.g. chemotherapy, bone‐marrow transplant, B‐cell depleting therapies, cytokine inhibition. 3. To use a computational biology approach to a) model the level of protection over time based on neutralizing antibody levels and b) model the boosting and decay of anti‐Spike IgG, specific memory B, T and NK cell response to provide information on the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine protection over time. 4. To use this evidence‐base to inform policies regarding timing of additional SARS‐CoV‐2 boosters in vulnerable populations about to commence immunosuppression/or following bone marrow transplant. These findings will identify those patient groups most appropriate for synthetic COVID‐19 monoclonal antibodies and will contribute to our understanding of vaccinology in the setting of immunosuppression and BMT more broadly, an area that remains poorly understood. 5. To compare the change in health‐related quality of life over time between "immediate" and "deferred" booster strategies.

AB  - In a blinded retrospective economic evaluation of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial, total utilisation and charges for lymphoid cancer patients who received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) or placebo were compared following autologous bone marrow transplantation. The 40 patients enrolled (22 rhGM-CSF, 18 placebo) could have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease, be of any age, and were undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation in a metropolitan cancer research centre. Main outcome measures consisted of initial hospital lengths of stay (LOS), total and department charges, rehospitalisation rates and charges, and outpatient charges, all inclusive of the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion. The perspective of the study is that of the third party payer. Initial hospitalisation charges were $US54 100 for patients who received rhGM-CSF and $US68 600 for patients who received placebo (p = 0.05). The difference of $US14 500 was 21% less in patients who received rhGM-CSF, mainly due to lower average LOS with rhGM-CSF (24.2 days) compared with placebo (30.8 days). Outpatient charges were $US9500 (rhGM-CSF) and $US6800 (placebo) {p = 0.18}. Total charges, including readmission (10 per group) were $US12 200 lower in the rhGM-CSF group ($US70 300 vs $US82 500, p = 0.19). The use of rhGM-CSF after autologous bone marrow transplantation was shown to result in substantial cost savings during the initial hospitalisation. When comparing total inpatient and outpatient medical charges within the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion, we found no evidence that these savings were negated.

AB  - Background: An innovative approach combining induction chemotherapy and subsequent consolidation with 90Yttrium-ibritumoma b-tiuxetan (90Y-IT) has been upgraded by shortening the chemotherapy duration and by insertion of rituximab, in untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: A prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, non-randomised phase II trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of a short fludarabine, mitoxantrone and rituximab (FMR) induction followed by radioimmunotherapy, in untreated, intermediate/high-risk, follicular NHL patients. Fifty-five patients were treated using a sequential treatment schedule consisting of 4 induction cycles of FMR chemo-immunotherapy, and a subsequent consolidating single administration of 90Y-IT, 8-12 weeks later. Patients were eligible for radioimmunotherapy if at least in partial response (PR) after induction, with normal platelet and granulocyte counts and a bone marrow infiltration <=25%. Primary study endpoints were response rate and hematological toxicities; secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Result(s): All patients received 4 induction cycles of FMR, with an overall response rate of 96.4% (38 complete responses, CR, and 15 PR). Fifty-one patients (38 in CR and 13 in PR) received 90Y-IT. By the end of the treatment, 49/55 patients achieved a CR. With a median follow-up of 21.3 months (95%CI 18.7-23.7), the estimated 3-year PFS was 80.6% (95%CI 53.7-92.8) and the 3-year OS 100.0%. Twenty-one patients showed grade 33 hematological toxicities. Conclusion(s): This study has established the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of a regimen composed by a short FMR induction with a 90Y-IT consolidation in untreated intermediate/high-risk follicular NHL patients.

AB  - We report the remission of primary gastric lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type in two immunocompromised pediatric patients. Patient 1, a 14-year-old boy in an immunocompromised state of unknown cause, complained of repeated abdominal pain. Examinations revealed gastric MALT with local invasion and lymph node involvement. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) antibody was positive. H pylori eradication was abandoned due to its adverse effects. The MALT lesion spontaneously regressed over the next 24 months without any treatment for lymphoma. Patient 2, a 6-year-old boy, underwent cord blood transplantation for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy. He was administered immunosuppressants for graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. Nausea and hematochezia appeared and further examinations revealed gastric MALT with H pylori gastritis. Treatment consisting of medication for the Hpylori infection alone eradicated the H pylori and completely resolved the patient's MALT lesion, as well. Patients 1 and 2 were followed up over periods of 10 years and 3 years, respectively, without any signs of relapse. In conclusion, gastric lymphoma of the MALT type can be cured by conservative treatment even in immunocompromised pediatric patients. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting the CD79b component of the B-cell receptor, has demonstrated activity as a single agent and in combination with rituximab in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this study, we evaluated the safety and preliminary activity of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Method(s): This was an open-label, non-randomised study composed of a phase 1b dose escalation and a phase 2 dose expansion at 11 hospitals and health centres in the USA and France. Patients aged 18 years or older with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were eligible. Exclusion criteria included peripheral neuropathy with grade greater than 1, major surgery within 4 weeks before enrolment, known CNS involvement of lymphoma, and uncontrolled heart disease. Phase 1b dose escalation had a three-plus-three design and established the recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 expansion evaluated the recommended phase 2 dose of polatuzumab vedotin in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with an International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2-5. Patients received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle orally (CHP), plus either rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of each cycle (R-CHP) or obinutuzumab 1000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of the following cycles (G-CHP). Polatuzumab vedotin was administered on day 2 of cycles 1 and 2, and on day 1 of the following cycles at 1.0-2.4 mg/kg during the escalation phase and at the recommended phase 2 dose during the expansion phase. Treatment could last six or eight cycles, depending on investigator preference. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and tolerability, and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (or recommended phase 2 dose) of polatuzumab vedotin. All endpoints were analysed per protocol in the safety evaluable population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992653. Finding(s): Between Dec 4, 2013, and July 26, 2016, 85 patients were enrolled. 82 patients were included in the safety and activity evaluable populations, 25 in phase 1b and 57 in phase 2. In light of information from other studies using polatuzumab vedotin reported during this study, in which the safety profile associated with exposure to polatuzumab vedotin at doses higher than 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks was not outweighed by any clinical benefit, the recommended phase 2 dose was set to 1.8 mg/kg in the R-CHP cohort and no higher doses were explored in this study. 66 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received the polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose (45 R-CHP; 21 G-CHP). In 66 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2 dose, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (20 [30%]), febrile neutropenia (12 [18%]), and thrombocytopenia (six [9%]). Among the 70 patients (any histology) who received the recommended phase 2 dose, 19 (27%) had grade 1 peripheral neuropathy, eight (11%) grade 2, and two (3%) grade 3. Four deaths were reported during follow-up: two treatment-related (one complication of atrial fibrillation and one septic shock) and two due to disease progression. As of the cutoff date of Dec 29, 2017, median follow-up time was 21.5 months (IQR 16.7-24.3) for the untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort treated at the polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose. 59 (89%) patients achieved an overall response at end of treatment (51 [77%] patients had a complete response, and eight [12%] patients had a partial response). Interpretation(s): The safety of incorporating polatuzumab vedotin to R-CHP or G-CHP was as expected and managable. Preliminary clinical activity in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma seems promising and encouraged a phase 3 trial comparing polatuzumab vedotin with R-CHP to R-CHOP.

AB  - Questions: 1. In what groups of lymphoma patients has rituximab been studied? 2. What beneficial treatment outcomes are associated with the use of rituximab in patients with lymphoma? 3. What is the toxicity of rituximab? 4. What patients are more-or-less likely to benefit from treatment with rituximab?. Perspective(s): Evidence was selected and reviewed by 2 people, one of whom is a member of the Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiatives Haematology Disease Site Group (DSG). This evidence summary has been reviewed, discussed, and approved by the DSG, which comprises haematologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, methodologists, and community representatives. Methodology: Sources of Evidence: Relevant evidence was identified by a systematic search of the MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, PUBMED databases, and the Cochrane Library (using the text words 'rituxan,' 'rituximab,' 'ritux:,' and 'IDEC C2B8'). Also searched were the American Society of Hematology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Lugano meeting conference proceedings; the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Physician Data Query databases; and reference lists from selected articles. Patient Population: Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Outcomes of Interest: Survival, quality of life, time-to-progression, response duration, response rate, and toxicity were the primary outcomes of interest. Result(s): Search Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified: 1 randomised trial of 2 different dosing strategies for rituximab in intermediate-grade lymphoma; 11 reports of single-arm studies of rituximab in follicular, low-grade lymphoma, or mantle-cell lymphoma; 1 abstract of a published paper; 8 abstracts of single-arm studies of rituximab in low- and intermediate-grade lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders; 3 abstracts of single-arm studies of rituximab in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or interferon alpha in follicular, low- or intermediate-grade lymphoma; 1 paper of a single-arm study of rituximab in combination with CHOP in follicular or low- grade lymphoma; 1 abstract of a single-arm study of rituximab in combination with fludarabine; 1 abstract of rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide; and 1 abstract of rituximab in combination with carmustine (BCNU), cyclophosphamide and etoposide in low-grade or follicular non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Benefits: The response rates were highest in patients with follicular lymphoma (60%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 52-68%) and lowest for those with small lymphocytic lymphoma (18%; 95% CI: 8-28%). Response rates were higher for patients still sensitive to conventional chemotherapy. Data on 1-year survival for mantle-cell lymphoma patients was 80% with a median duration of response of 14.4 months. Data on quality of life were not available. Harms: Detailed toxicity data were provided in the published phase II study. The majority of patients (84%) treated with rituximab in this study had adverse events. The most common of these were: fever (43%), chills (28%), nausea (18%), headache (14%), and allergic symptoms (43%) including angio-oedema (14%). Severe (grade 3 or 4) toxicity was uncommon. Little haematologic toxicity was noted and there did not appear to be any increase in infections up to 1 year after therapy. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first infusion. A 'Dear Doctor' letter was issued indicating that following approval of the drug in the United States (November 1997) and in Europe (June 1998), there were reports of 8 fatalities resulting from cytokine-release syndrome in an estimated 12 000-14 000 treated patients. These reactions occurred early in the first infusion. This appears more common in patients with high tumour burden or who have more than 50 x 109 circulating malignant cells per litre. Future Steps: Rituximab alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, is being compared with conventional chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, as well as those with newly diagnosed, low-grade or follicular lymphoma. It is also being evaluated as part of initial therapy for intermediate-grade lymphoma. At present, the evidence does not allow a firm clinical recommendation on this topic. Please see the full report for a more detailed discussion of the evidence, an interpretive summary, and a description of the opinions of the Disease Site Group members.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the results of the diagnostic imaging modalities, especially ultrasonography (US) in children during the oncological therapy with the acute abdominal symptoms. Acute abdominal symptoms in children with neoplasms causing a very difficult clinical and diagnostic problems and can occure in any stage of disease. Materials/Methods: We analyzed 249 ultrasounds examinations of the abdominal cavity in 144 girls and 105 boys aged from 1 to 18 years (mean age 1o, 3 years). The more important indication for the US exam in 133 cases was acute abdominal symptoms. We took exams during pre- and postoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy and after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. All the patients were under routine hematological control. Based on the clinical symptoms and the laboratory tests we analysed two groups of children with oncological disease and acute abdomen: I group-111 children with neutropenia, II group-22 children without neutropenia. In the patients who underwent operation procedure the final diagnosis was established on histopathology. In the other cases diagnosis was based on clinical, laboratory and radiological exams, especially ultrasonography. We analyzed clinical picture of disease, the results of therapy and the US changes in examed patients using statistic parameters as: sensitivity, specificity and efficiency. Result(s): In the group of 133 children with acute abdominal symptoms the most (92-69,1%) patients suffer from ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and 16(12%) - from AML (acute lympoblastic leukaemia), Ewing sarcoma-3(2,2%), osteosarcoma-3(2,2%), NHL-8(6,0%), HL-4(3%), nephroblastoma-4(3%), neuroblastoma-3 (2,2%). Acute abdominal symptoms can have a very different etiology: bacterial, mycotic and virusal infections or continious infiltration of gastrointestinal tract by tumor. Clinical symptoms of the acute abdominal diseases are very severe, because the oncological patients usually have immunologic deficiency and oblige us to proper clinical observation or to operation procedure, very often as an emergency. The symptoms appeard in the different time of course of oncological diseases. Nonspecific gastrointestinal inflammation with haemorrhage and typhlitis were the main cause of the acute abdominal pain in 71 children with neutropenia during therapy of leucaemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The accuracy of ultrasound findings verified intraoperatively and by histopathologic examinations was 84%. In all cases the morphological changes were directly related to the signs and symptoms duration. Conclusion(s): The high-resolution ultrasound has a very important role in diagnosis in all patients with acute abdominal pain and with neoplasms. The authors consider that the US should be the first imaging method in the differential diagnosis of the abdominal changes in children with neutropenia and oncological disease. Proper diagnosis should be established only with clinical information.     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 0.194068009844173     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Background: High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has become the standard of care for patients with relapsed chemo-sensitive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Various conditioning regimens have been developed to improve outcome, but no regimen has proven superior. We compare the outcomes of Carmustine, Etoposide, Cytarabine, Melphalan (BEAM) used at the Ohio State University to that of Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide (BUCYVP16) used at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Aim(s): To compare the efficacy and toxicity of BEAM and BUCYVP16 conditioning regimens in patients with relapsed NHL undergoing AHSCT. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed patients treated with BEAM (n=269) or BUCYVP16 (n=409) followed by AHSCT between 2006 and 2014. Kaplan- Meier estimates were used to analyze progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was measured from transplant date until relapse, treating deaths as competing risks using Pepe and Mori test. Result(s): Patient characteristics were similar for age (median 60 (20-77) vs 58 (27-78)), disease stage at diagnosis (p=0.29), prior radiation exposure (p=0.68), and response status at transplant (94.7% CR/PR vs 93.2%) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16 respectively. Differences were number of prior treatments (median 2 (1-8) vs 2 (1-13), p<0.01), comorbidity index (74.0% 0-3 vs 80.9%, p=0.03), and median CD34 dose infused (4.3 vs 6.02, p<0.01) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16. Median follow-up from diagnosis and transplant was 6.6 years and 4.0 years respectively for BEAM and 7.0 years and 4.3 years for BUCYVP16. Median day to neutrophil engraftment was 10 (8-19) vs 10 (9-15) (p<0.01) and median time to platelet engraftment was 18 (11-69) vs 16 (3-129) (p<0.01) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16. There were no statistical differences in CIR, PFS or OS. At 1, 3 and 5 years from AHSCT, PFS was 75%, 59%, and 46% vs 72%, 54%, and 44% (p=0.52); OS 88%, 75%, and 66% vs 83%, 69% and 59% (p=0.11) in the BEAM vs BUCYVP16 groups respectively (Figure 1). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was higher in the BEAM group (7 pts (2.6%) compared to none in BYCYVP16 (p<0.01)) but grade 3 or 4 mucositis was lower in BEAM (24.2%) compared to 56.1% in BUCYVP16 (p<0.01). There were no differences in hemorrhagic cystitis or second primary malignancy. Summary/Conclusions: This large retrospective study showed no statistical difference in PFS, OS, or CIR between BEAM and BUCVP16 conditioning regimens for AHSCT in relapsed NHL. Veno-occlusive disease occurred more frequently in the BEAM group, while grade 3 or 4 mucositis occurred more frequently in the BUCYVP16 group. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Haploidentical-cord blood transplantation is a promising approach for patients (pts) who lack HLA donors and may improve rates of early engraftment while allowing long term cord blood reconstitution with low rates of GVHD. We enrolled 29 pts (17 AML/MDS, 4 ALL, 3 CML, 4 NHL/HL, 1 severe aplastic anemia) lacking HLA identical donors. The median age was 40 years (range, 4-67), and median weight was 75 kg (range, 14-125). Twenty-two (76%) pts had active disease at time of transplant; 6 had prior autologous transplants. 14 pts were Caucasian; 15 were other race or ethnicity. The haploidentical donor was the mother in 4; father in 3; child in 10; sibling in 10; and half-sibling in 2 cases. The median haploidentical CD34+ dose was 2.51 x 106/kg (range, 1.25-10.95); CD3+ cells were 1.0 x 104/kg (range, 0.3-3.7). Single unrelated CB units were matched by low resolution at HLA-A and B and high-resolution at DRB1, and matched 6/6 in 2 pts; 5/6 in 18 pts; 4/6 in 9 pts. Median cord total nucleated cells equaled 1.93 x 107/kg (range, 1.07-9.36); CD34+ cells were 0.08 x 106/kg (range, 0.03-0.75). The conditioning regimen for 18 pts was fludarabine (Flu) (30 mg/m2 on d-7 through -3), melphalan (Mel) (70 mg/m2 on d -3 and -2), and Thymoglobulin (rATG) (1.5 mg/kg on d-7, -5, -3, -1). Eleven pts received Flu, thiotepa (5 mg/kg on d -7 and -6), total-body irradiation (TBI) (12 Gy lateral opposed fields in 2 Gy fractions BID on d-3 through -1), and rATG. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus (Tac) + methylprednisolone or Tac + mycophenolate. Engraftment: Two pts died early (sepsis, CVA). Three other pts failed to engraft with either haploidentical or CB and died of infection on d36, 43, and 63. One of these had anti-donor HLA antibodies. 24 pts engrafted with a median time to ANC >500/mL of 10 days (range, 9-31) and median time to sustained platelets >20,000/mL of 20 days (range, 15-63). In the majority of pts, early haploidentical engraftment was replaced by durable engraftment of CB by 100 days. However, 3 pts had persistent hematopoiesis associated with only the haploidentical donor, while a fourth pt engrafted with only CB on day 31. Late graft failure and death from sepsis occurred in one of the patients with haploidentical engraftment. In unfractionated peripheral blood or bone marrow cells, median haploidentical chimerism was 95% (range, 0-100) on d14; 76% (range, 0-95) on d30; 6% (range, 0-87) on d100. Median unfractionated cord chimerism was <5% (range, 0-100) on d14; 20% (range, 0-100) on d30; 85% (range, 0-100) on d100. In the CD3+ compartment, median haploidentical chimerism was 95% (range, 0-100) on d14; 86% (range, 0-95) on d30; 6% (range, 0-79) on d100. Median CD3+ cord chimerism was 5% (range, 0-100) on d14; 26% (range, 0-100) on d30; 90% (range, 1-100) on d100. Toxicities and outcome: Other fatal toxicities included VOD (1), EBV-associated PTLD (1), ARDS (1), cardiac arrest (1), intractable seizures (1). Two patients developed TTP and later died of complications related to sepsis. Five pts relapsed of whom 4 have died. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II occurred in 3 pts, one of whom developed the only case of chronic GVHD after failing to continue prograf. No aGVHD grade III-IV was seen. Twelve pts are currently alive; 11 are without disease. The median follow up for survivors is 186 days (range, 16-642). Estimated one year survival is 26% (95%CI, 6-46), and PFS is 19% (1-36). Conclusion(s): Combined haploidentical and CB transplantation results in early haploidentical engraftment followed by durable CB predominance in a majority of pts. The median times to neutrophil engraftment are considerably shorter - and the range narrower - than with other methods of cord blood transplantation. Early haploidentical engraftment failed in four patients; cord blood engraftment also failed in three of these pts and in three others. Rates of acute and particularly of chronic GVHD are low. Durable remissions can be achieved even in high risk pts regardless of age or remission status at the time of transplant.

AB  - The cost-effectiveness of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) compared with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Morbus Hodgkin (MH) was assessed. Costs were determined from the induction chemotherapy regimen up to 3 months after discharge from hospital following the transplantation. Quality of life was measured by the EuroQol, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and the SF-36. Patients were randomised according to a 2:1 ratio to undergo either PBSCT or ABMT. 62 patients underwent PBSCT and 29 ABMT. Costs of the transplantation period were significantly lower in the PBSCT group (15008 Euros) than in the ABMT group (19000 Euros). Significant differences in quality of life were all in favour of PBSCT and emerged using the RSCL, both on 14 days after the transplantation and three months after discharge. We conclude that PBSCT is associated with lower costs and a better quality of life than ABMT for patients with refractory or relapsed NHL or MH.

AB  - Background: High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by transplantation of autologous haemopoietic stem cells is frequently done as part of first-line therapy in young patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma. We investigated whether HDT with cytotoxic agents identical to those used for conventional therapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) improved survival outcome compared with conventional chemotherapy when rituximab was added to both modalities. Method(s): We did an open-label, randomised trial comparing conventional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone) and rituximab (R-CHOEP-14) with dose-escalated sequential HDT and rituximab (R-MegaCHOEP) followed by repetitive ASCT in high-risk (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index [IPI] 2 or 3) patients aged 18-60 years with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients received radiotherapy for bulky, extranodal disease, or both. Randomisation (1:1) used the Pocock minimisation algorithm; patients were stratified by age-adjusted IPI factors, bulky disease, and centre. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. All analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00129090. Finding(s): 136 patients were randomly assigned to R-CHOEP-14 and 139 to R-MegaCHOEP. 130 patients in the R-CHOEP-14 group and 132 in the R-MegaCHOEP group were included in the intention-to-treat population. After a median of 42 months (IQR 29-59), 3-year event-free survival was 69.5% (95% CI 61.3-77.7) in the R-CHOEP-14 group and 61.4% (52.8-70.0) in the R-MegaCHOEP group (p=0.14; hazard ratio 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-2.0). All 128 evaluable patients treated with R-MegaCHOEP had grade 4 leucopenia, as did 48 (58.5%) of 82 patients with documented blood counts in the R-CHOEP-14 group. All 128 evaluable patients in the R-MegaCHOEP group had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, as did 26 (33.8%) of 77 patients in the R-CHOEP-14 group with documented blood counts. The most important non-haematological grade 3 or 4 adverse event was infection, which occurred in 96 (75.0%) of 128 patients treated with R-MegaCHOEP and in 40 (31.3%) of 128 patients treated with R-CHOEP-14. Interpretation(s): In young patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma, R-MegaCHOEP was not superior to conventional R-CHOEP therapy and was associated with significantly more toxic effects. R-CHOEP-14 with or without radiotherapy remains a treatment option for these patients, with encouraging efficacy. Funding(s): Deutsche Krebshilfe. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The incidence of mucositis caused by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is relatively high. The severe painful mucositis can reduce the quality of life of patients obviously. Transdermal fentanyl is efficient in treating chronic pain of cancer, and also can relieve the severe pain of mucositis resulted from chemotherapy. This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl for the severe painful mucositis caused by AHSCT. METHODS: A total of 22 malignant tumor patients suffered from severe mucositis caused by high dose chemotherapy combined AHSCT. The analgesic degree before and after treatment was evaluated by the scores of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (range 0-10). The median VAS scores of all patients were above 4 (moderate to severe pain) before the administration of transdermal fentanyl. The quality of life before and after treatment was evaluated by the Standard of Quality of Life drew up in China in 1990. The adverse events after treatment were evaluated by Common Toxicity Criteria formulated by National Cancer Institute of the USA. RESULTS: The median VAS score has been decreased from baseline at 6 (4-9) to 3.5 (0-9) on Day 3, 2 (0-6) on Day 5, 0.5 (0-8) on Day 7, 0 (0-6) on Day 10, and 0 (0-5) on Day 15 after treatment (P<0.001). The overall response rate was 100%, while the complete response rate was 45.5%. The quality of life of the patients was improved significantly (P<0.01). The adverse events after treatment of transdermal fentanyl included dizziness, somnolence, dysuria, mild and transient nausea, vomiting, discomfort of stomach, and so on. All the adverse events disappeared within several days after proper managements. Neither severe adverse event nor drug addiction was found. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal fentanyl has good analgesic effect on painful severe mucositis induced by AHSCT. It is convenient and well tolerated, and could improve quality of life significantly.
