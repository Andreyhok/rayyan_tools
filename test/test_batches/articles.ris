AB  - Purpose: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at risk for cognitive decline. Cross-sectional studies show patients' complaints of cognitive decline do not correlate well with concurrently measured objective neuropsychological performance, but rather with emotional variables and health-related quality of life. This longitudinal study investigated whether patient self-report of cognitive status would be concordant with objectively measured neuropsychological performance after accounting for change from their own pre-transplant objective baseline. Method(s): Pre-HSCT and at 30 and 100 days post-HSCT, 46 patients underwent computerized neuropsychological testing (CogState) and completed surveys assessing patient-reported cognitive complaints, emotional symptoms (depression, anxiety), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and physical and functional well-being. Correlations were calculated between cognitive complaints and neuropsychological performance (at each time-point and across time-points), as well as all other patient-reported variables. Result(s): Patient-reported cognitive complaints were largely independent of concurrently assessed objective neuropsychological performance. Uniquely, our longitudinal data demonstrated significant medium to large effect size associations between subjective cognitive complaints post-HSCT with objectively measured change from pre-HSCT in attention, visual learning, and working memory (p <.05-.01). Subjective cognitive complaints post-HSCT were also associated with depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness and physical well-being (p <.05-.001). Conclusion(s): Patients appear better able to assess their cognitive functioning relative to their own baseline and changes across time rather than relative to community norms. Thus, patient complaints of cognitive compromise justify further in-depth neuropsychological, emotional, and functional assessment. Future research into relationships between cognitive complaints and neuropsychological performance should account for changes in performance over time.Copyright Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mucosal toxicity is dose limiting for etoposide. This may be related to the direct effects of etoposide on the mucosa. Twelve patients receiving etoposide 1800 mg/m2 as part of a myeloablative pre-transplant regimen were randomized to receive propantheline 30 mg or placebo orally every 6 h for six doses. Mucositis was less frequent (2 of 6 vs 5 of 6) and less severe (p = 0.05) in the propantheline arm. There were no differences in tumor response or survival between the two groups. Propantheline is an anticholinergic that causes xerostomia by decreasing salivation. Propantheline may reduce the salivary excretion of etoposide and could reduce its toxic effects on the mucosa. Propantheline is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients receiving high-dose etoposide.

AB  - Background: Effective DLBCL adjuvant therapy after first-line chemotherapy is needed as high-risk DLBCL is associated with a poor 4-year overall survival (OS) rate (Sehn et al, Blood 2007;109:1857-61). In a phase II study of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in relapsed, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL patients (n=47) had a 30% overall response rate (Witzig et al, Leukemia 2011;25:341-7). Method(s): PILLAR-2 is an ongoing international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study designed to compare everolimus efficacy and safety with that of placebo in poor-risk DLBCL patients who achieved complete response (CR) with first-line rituximab-based chemotherapy (R-chemo) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00790036 ; sponsor: Novartis Pharmaceuticals). Eligibility criteria include age 18 years; confirmed stage II bulky, III, or IV DLBCL and International Prognostic Index 3-5 at diagnosis; confirmed CR per revised International Workshop Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al, J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579-86) after first-line R-chemo regimen completed 6-14 weeks before study drug start; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2; no ongoing or post-R-chemo radiation; and no myelosuppressive chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 3 weeks. Patients are randomized 1:1 to everolimus 10 mg once daily or matching placebo and treated for 12 months or until disease relapse, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Radiologic tumor assessment is performed at baseline, every 12 weeks during years 1 and 2, every 24 weeks during years 3 and 4, and annually thereafter until start of new anticancer therapy or 5 years after last patient randomization. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints are OS, lymphoma-specific survival, and safety. Expected enrollment is 687 patients. Final analysis will be performed when 279 DFS events occur; survival follow-up will continue until 338 deaths occur and the last randomized patient has been followed for 5 years. Currently, 422 patients are enrolled. The data monitoring committee last reviewed the trial in July 2011 and recommended that it continue as planned.

AB  - Study question: This study aims to analyze alterations in proteomic profiles and validate selected protein biomarkers of spermatozoa in men with history of undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Summary answer: Cancer-associated protein was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis and database searching. And the protein was validated by Western-blotting. What is known already: As advanced cancer treatments have improved the prognosis of cancer survivors, these treatments such as chemotherapy have been known to cause harmful effect on fertile capacity. A few studies reported the alternation in proteins of spermatozoa between cancer patients and healthy donor and some proteins with different expression levels were identified between two groups. Study design, size, duration: This research is a cross-sectional cell-line research of control versus treatment. A group of patients with a history of anticancer drug administration in cancer diagnosis was assigned as 'cancer group'(n=3), and a fertile donor group was assigned as 'control group'(n=3). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and this study design was approved by institutional review board of Yokohama City University Medical Center. Participants/materials, setting, methods: The original diseases of cancer group were non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma(n=2) and soft tissue tumor(n=1). Measuring the total sperm count by CASA, they were adjusted to 6 million in all specimens, and protein concentration was adjusted by BCA assay. After trypsin digestion and desalting, the expressed proteins in spermatozoa were analyzed by LQ-MS/MS and database searching was performed in two groups. Validation was performed for the proteins with different expression levels by Western-blotting. Main results and the role of chance: A total of 1,152 proteins and 5,268 peptides were identified by global proteomics in both groups. Sorted by max fold change of expressions (>5 folds) and ANOVA (p<0.01), 29 proteins were identified. Of these identified proteins, we focused on one protein, which is cancer-associated protein highly expressed in digestive tract and urinary tract. In sperm of patients with cancer, this protein was overexpressed 54.8-folds more than that of fertile donor. This protein co-works with other protein of T-cell proliferation factor. Regimens of cancer chemotherapy patients in cancer group received were ABVD and IFM, ADM, and VCM therapy, respectively.By the Western-blotting, expression of this protein was validated. Limitations, reasons for caution: Limitations of this research was inability to compare the sperm before and after the administration of cancer chemotherapy, because spermatozoa were all cryopreserved for fertility preservation before treatment. Wider implications of the findings: It was speculated that T cell proliferation was induced by interaction between these proteins after induction of cancer chemotherapy. Functional analysis of these proteins would provide clue to the mechanisms of impaired spermatogenesis after cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: Haploidentical-cord blood transplantation is a promising approach for patients (pts) who lack HLA donors and may improve rates of early engraftment while allowing long term cord blood reconstitution with low rates of GVHD. We enrolled 29 pts (17 AML/MDS, 4 ALL, 3 CML, 4 NHL/HL, 1 severe aplastic anemia) lacking HLA identical donors. The median age was 40 years (range, 4-67), and median weight was 75 kg (range, 14-125). Twenty-two (76%) pts had active disease at time of transplant; 6 had prior autologous transplants. 14 pts were Caucasian; 15 were other race or ethnicity. The haploidentical donor was the mother in 4; father in 3; child in 10; sibling in 10; and half-sibling in 2 cases. The median haploidentical CD34+ dose was 2.51 x 106/kg (range, 1.25-10.95); CD3+ cells were 1.0 x 104/kg (range, 0.3-3.7). Single unrelated CB units were matched by low resolution at HLA-A and B and high-resolution at DRB1, and matched 6/6 in 2 pts; 5/6 in 18 pts; 4/6 in 9 pts. Median cord total nucleated cells equaled 1.93 x 107/kg (range, 1.07-9.36); CD34+ cells were 0.08 x 106/kg (range, 0.03-0.75). The conditioning regimen for 18 pts was fludarabine (Flu) (30 mg/m2 on d-7 through -3), melphalan (Mel) (70 mg/m2 on d -3 and -2), and Thymoglobulin (rATG) (1.5 mg/kg on d-7, -5, -3, -1). Eleven pts received Flu, thiotepa (5 mg/kg on d -7 and -6), total-body irradiation (TBI) (12 Gy lateral opposed fields in 2 Gy fractions BID on d-3 through -1), and rATG. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus (Tac) + methylprednisolone or Tac + mycophenolate. Engraftment: Two pts died early (sepsis, CVA). Three other pts failed to engraft with either haploidentical or CB and died of infection on d36, 43, and 63. One of these had anti-donor HLA antibodies. 24 pts engrafted with a median time to ANC >500/mL of 10 days (range, 9-31) and median time to sustained platelets >20,000/mL of 20 days (range, 15-63). In the majority of pts, early haploidentical engraftment was replaced by durable engraftment of CB by 100 days. However, 3 pts had persistent hematopoiesis associated with only the haploidentical donor, while a fourth pt engrafted with only CB on day 31. Late graft failure and death from sepsis occurred in one of the patients with haploidentical engraftment. In unfractionated peripheral blood or bone marrow cells, median haploidentical chimerism was 95% (range, 0-100) on d14; 76% (range, 0-95) on d30; 6% (range, 0-87) on d100. Median unfractionated cord chimerism was <5% (range, 0-100) on d14; 20% (range, 0-100) on d30; 85% (range, 0-100) on d100. In the CD3+ compartment, median haploidentical chimerism was 95% (range, 0-100) on d14; 86% (range, 0-95) on d30; 6% (range, 0-79) on d100. Median CD3+ cord chimerism was 5% (range, 0-100) on d14; 26% (range, 0-100) on d30; 90% (range, 1-100) on d100. Toxicities and outcome: Other fatal toxicities included VOD (1), EBV-associated PTLD (1), ARDS (1), cardiac arrest (1), intractable seizures (1). Two patients developed TTP and later died of complications related to sepsis. Five pts relapsed of whom 4 have died. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II occurred in 3 pts, one of whom developed the only case of chronic GVHD after failing to continue prograf. No aGVHD grade III-IV was seen. Twelve pts are currently alive; 11 are without disease. The median follow up for survivors is 186 days (range, 16-642). Estimated one year survival is 26% (95%CI, 6-46), and PFS is 19% (1-36). Conclusion(s): Combined haploidentical and CB transplantation results in early haploidentical engraftment followed by durable CB predominance in a majority of pts. The median times to neutrophil engraftment are considerably shorter - and the range narrower - than with other methods of cord blood transplantation. Early haploidentical engraftment failed in four patients; cord blood engraftment also failed in three of these pts and in three others. Rates of acute and particularly of chronic GVHD are low. Durable remissions can be achieved even in high risk pts regardless of age or remission status at the time of transplant.

AB  - Half-body irradiation at a single dose of 400-800 cGy was delivered to patients with disseminated fast-growing types of lymphomas and large aggregates of tumors and vital dysfunction of the body (the compression syndrome). Active detoxification therapy including heparinization, hemodilution with enforced diuresis and hemosorption was performed to prevent the syndrome of acute tumor lysis and postradiation complications. This treatment modality resulted in the elimination of clinical manifestations of the compression syndrome, normalization of the body homeostasis, a considerable reduction of the volume of tumor aggregates on a short-term basis, entering the patients into a curable state; the 5-year follow-up results were evaluated.

AB  - To circumvent aGVHD in the early phase after allogeneic stem cell transplantation but to provide GVL activity later on, we performed alloPBSCT with CD34+ selected grafts followed by delayed add-back of CD3+ T cells. Ten consecutive patients having an HLA-identical sibling donor were enrolled on to this trial. Four patients were in first CR of high-risk ALL, another four in first CR of AML, one was in second myeloid blast crisis of CML, and one was in PR of relapsed NHL. Conditioning consisted of 2 x 60 mg/kg CY plus 12 Gy TBI. G-CSF (Filgrastim) mobilized peripheral cells were CD34+ selected using the Isolex 300i system in nine patients and the CliniMacs system in one. Median CD34+ purity was 86%. A median of 2.8 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells were transplanted. The number of CD3+ cells in the allografts was 5.7 x 10(4)/kg (median) after Isolex 300i, and 0.2 x 10(4)/kg after CliniMacs. All patients received G-CSF (Filgrastim) and engrafted rapidly. Standard-dose CsA was administered, and until day +60 no aGVHD occurred. At that time point, seven patients received 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells while CsA had been tapered to 50% of the starting dose. One of these patients died after a second T cell boost given on day +90 without concomitant immunosuppression due to grade IV intestinal aGVHD. Three others developed cutaneous cGVHD. Taken together, T cell depletion by CD34+ selection does not impair rapid engraftment in the HLA-identical sibling donor setting. Using standard-dose CsA the risk for acute GVHD seems to be minimized. Add-back of 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells on day +60 with CsA protection is feasible. However, whether this is the optimal time point and number of T cells remain to be further elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hu5F9-G4 (hereafter, 5F9) antibody is a macrophage immune checkpoint inhibitor blocking CD47 that induces tumor-cell phagocytosis. 5F9 synergizes with rituximab to eliminate B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells by enhancing macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. This combination was evaluated clinically. METHOD(S): We conducted a phase 1b study involving patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients may have had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma. 5F9 (at a priming dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously, with weekly maintenance doses of 10 to 30 mg per kilogram) was given with rituximab to determine safety and efficacy and to suggest a phase 2 dose. RESULT(S): A total of 22 patients (15 with DLBCL and 7 with follicular lymphoma) were enrolled. Patients had received a median of 4 (range, 2 to 10) previous therapies, and 95% of the patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were anemia and infusion-related reactions. Anemia (an expected on-target effect) was mitigated by the strategy of 5F9 prime and maintenance dosing. Dose-limiting side effects were rare. A selected phase 2 dose of 30 mg of 5F9 per kilogram led to an approximate 100% CD47-receptor occupancy on circulating white and red cells. A total of 50% of the patients had an objective (i.e., complete or partial) response, with 36% having a complete response. The rates of objective response and complete response were 40% and 33%, respectively, among patients with DLBCL and 71% and 43%, respectively, among those with follicular lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months among patients with DLBCL and 8.1 months among those with follicular lymphoma, 91% of the responses were ongoing. CONCLUSION(S): The macrophage checkpoint inhibitor 5F9 combined with rituximab showed promising activity in patients with aggressive and indolent lymphoma. No clinically significant safety events were observed in this initial study.Copyright Â© 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB  - Introduction: The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens enabled successful HCT in patients above 60 years. However, the impact of age on outcome in patients >60 years has not been evaluated extensively. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 104 consecutive patients (f=53, m=61) aged >60 who received allogeneic HCT 2000-2010 at our institution. Median age of the patients was 65 years (range, 61-76). Patients were grouped in two cohorts: group 1 aged 60-65 years (n=59, median age=63) and group 2 aged 66-76 years (n=45, median age=68). Diagnoses were acute leukemia (AML=63, ALL=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=13), osteomyelofibrosis (n=7), Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (n=7), multiple myeloma (n=8), aplastic anemia (n=1), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=2) and chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=2). At time of HCT 39 of the patients were in complete remission (CR), 65 in partial remission (PR). Conditioning regimens were grouped in high (TBI/Bu+Cy, n=5), intermediate (FLAMSA, Flu/Mel/BCNU, n=27), low (FLU+alkylans, n=44) and minimal (2GyTBI/Flu, n=28) intensity. Intermediate intensity conditioning was particularly used for high risk patients in PR (24/27 patients). 20 patients were transplanted from matched related (MRD), 45 from matched unrelated (MUD) and 39 from mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD). Result(s): Kaplan-Meier-estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) was 44% with a non-significant advantage for patients in CR vs. PR (51 vs. 40%, p=0.25). Non-relapse-mortality was 32%. The outcomes with intermediate, low and minimal intensity conditioning were comparable (3-year OS 50% vs. 47% vs. 46%) while all patients after high intensity conditioning died. HCT from MRD had an inferior OS compared to MUD or MMUD (3-year-OS 0% vs. 42 and 36% respectively for group 1, 33% vs. 73 and 65% respectively for group 2, not significant). Incidences of acute GVHD >=II, limited and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 12, 23 and 13%, respectively. Acute GVHD >=II was associated with inferior outcome (3-year OS of 18 vs. 41%, p=0.004). 3-year OS for group 1 and 2 were 30 and 67%, respectively (p=0.02). Patients in group 2 had a better outcome with low and minimal intensity vs. intermediate conditioning (3-year OS 84 and 70% vs. 51%, not significant). Conclusion(s): Age has no major impact on outcome of allogeneic HCT. Patient aged >60 seem to benefit from the use of MUD rather than an older MRD. The regimen used should be tailored to disease risk and patient performance status.

AB  - High-intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is an aggressive form of the disease, which can respond well to combination chemotherapy, with long-term survival seen in 40-50% of patients. When NHL relapses following standard treatment, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow support may still cure a significant proportion of patients. Despite a significant rise in the incidence of NHL over recent years, there remains only limited published economic study concerning the overall lifetime cost of treatment, the cost effectiveness of specific treatments or the overall societal cost burden of the disease. The majority of studies identified for the purposes of this review considered the cost of alternative forms of chemotherapy and bone marrow support strategies for patients with advanced disease. Data from these studies suggest that there is a definite trend towards reduced costs for high-dose therapy, possibly reflecting increasing technical experience and improved bone marrow recovery through the use of stem cell transplantation and growth factors. The limited number of cost-effectiveness evaluations suggest that high-dose therapy, following a chemosensitive relapse, is likely to be considered favourable against commonly quoted cost-effectiveness thresholds. Cost effectiveness is becoming an increasingly important factor to consider in the formal assessment of new interventions conducted by groups such as the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence. In light of the increasing incidence of NHL and the extended use of high-dose treatments in other subgroups of patients, there is a need for increased research into the economics of new interventions for NHL.

AB  - Introduction: Readmission is the main reason for failure in an at home-care program and also of patient's dissatisfaction. Neutropenic fever (NF) is the major extrahematological complication in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and a mandatory reason for readmission in most current home-care programs. Material (or patients) and methods: Between November 2000 and November 2015, 211 consecutive patients were managed at-home since day +1 of ASCT conditioned with BEAM, for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n = 136), and with standard dose of Melphalan for MM (n = 75). Antibacterial prophylaxis included levofloxacin 500 mg/d (p.o.) plus ceftriaxone 1 g/d (i.v.) or piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/ 8 h (i.v.). First-line therapy of NF was piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/6 h (i.v.) or refrigerated meropenem 1 g/8 h (i.v.) using a portable intermittent infusion pump for both drugs. Teicoplanin was added if oral mucositis of NCI-CTC-score grade >=2, signs of infection at the catheter insertion, or Gram-positive infection. Amikacin was started if fever persisted more than 3 days or in case of Gram-negative infection. Fever without hemodynamic instability responsive to first-line antibiotics was treated at-home. Only patients with NF and focal infection, persistent fever or signs of severe sepsis were readmitted. Result(s): Median age at transplantation was 48.6 (range, 17 to 69) years. All patients included had a good performance status (ECOG<=2). The quantity of peripheral blood CD34+ cell dose (x106/kg) infused was 3.9 (range, 1.5 to 21). Recovery (days) of granulocyte count above 0.5x109/l was 11 (range, 7 to 26). The global incidence of grades >=2 oral mucositis and gastrointestinal toxicity (NCI-CTC-score) was 21%. Of the 211 patients, 129 (61%) developed NF. Median day of appearance of fever was day +4 (range, day +2 to +13). Patients with fever received intravenous antibiotics for a median of 8 (range, 5 to 16) days, and teicoplanin and/or amikacin was added in 62 (48%) of the 129 febrile episodes. Bacterial infection was documented in 23 (18%) of febrile episodes. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci was the more frequent bacteria isolated (n = 17; 74%). The other infectious agents were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Streptococcus viridans (n = 1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). Of the 129 patients developing NF only 22 (17%) fulfilled criteria for readmission: pneumonia (n = 4), persistent fever (n = 15) and severe sepsis with hemodynamic instability (n = 3) requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit. Therefore, in 107 (83%) patients the NF was managed fully at-home and none of them died, while one (4.5%) of the patients readmitted died, which was due to respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (P=0.17). Readmission rate by NF in MM patients was constant over time (16%), while lymphoma patients autografted since March 2007 experienced a dramatic reduction of readmission rate with the use of piperacillintazobactam as primary antibacterial prophylaxis (15/62 (24%) vs. 1/31 (3%); P=0.02). Conclusion(s): In our home-care experience, NF per se is not a mandatory reason for readmission using simple clinical criteria. Likewise, the use of prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam reduces significantly the need for hospital readmission in lymphoma patients receiving BEAM, optimizing both domiciliary and hospital resources.

AB  - We report the remission of primary gastric lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type in two immunocompromised pediatric patients. Patient 1, a 14-year-old boy in an immunocompromised state of unknown cause, complained of repeated abdominal pain. Examinations revealed gastric MALT with local invasion and lymph node involvement. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) antibody was positive. H pylori eradication was abandoned due to its adverse effects. The MALT lesion spontaneously regressed over the next 24 months without any treatment for lymphoma. Patient 2, a 6-year-old boy, underwent cord blood transplantation for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy. He was administered immunosuppressants for graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. Nausea and hematochezia appeared and further examinations revealed gastric MALT with H pylori gastritis. Treatment consisting of medication for the Hpylori infection alone eradicated the H pylori and completely resolved the patient's MALT lesion, as well. Patients 1 and 2 were followed up over periods of 10 years and 3 years, respectively, without any signs of relapse. In conclusion, gastric lymphoma of the MALT type can be cured by conservative treatment even in immunocompromised pediatric patients. Â© 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Real-world practice patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), including the adoption of maintenance rituximab (MR) therapy in the United States (US), have been reported in few studies since the release of the National LymphoCare Study almost a decade ago. We analyzed data from the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), to identify rates of adoption and effectiveness of MR in FL patients after first-line (1L) treatment. We identified previously untreated patients with FL in the VHA between 2006 and 2014 who achieved at least stable disease after chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy. Among these patients, those who initiated MR within 238 days of 1L composed the MR group, whereas those who did not were classified as the non-MR group. We examined the effect of MR on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 676 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 300 received MR. MR was associated with significant PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55, P <.001) and OS (HR = 0.53, P =.005) compared to the non-MR group, after adjusting by age, sex, ethnicity, geographic region, diagnosis period, stage, grade at diagnosis, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 1L treatment regimen, and response to 1L treatment. These results suggest that in FL patients who do not experience disease progression after 1L treatment in real-world settings, MR is associated with a significant improvement in both PFS and OS. Maintenance therapy should be considered in FL patients who successfully complete and respond to 1L therapy.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We studied the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 220 mg/m2 melphalan (HDM 220) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in 16 patients with advanced haematological malignancies. Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean values of steady-state volume of distribution 14.6 l/m2, total body clearance 313 ml/min/m2, elimination half-life 46 min) were the same as those of 140 or 200 mg/m2 melphalan in previous reports. HDM 220 was feasible. Extramedullary toxicity was mainly W.H.O. grade 4 mucositis (13/16 patients). The median duration of 41 d (10, not reached) of thrombocytopenia < 25 x 10(9)/l was long. In multiple myeloma the response rate was 89% in heavily pretreated patients, suggesting that HDM 220 could be considered earlier in the course of the disease as an alternative consolidation therapy.

AB  - Disseminated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy regimens, and more than 50% of patients die within 5 years of their first relapse. Therefore, newer treatment approaches have been used to try to improve survival and ultimately provide a cure for patients with disseminated indolent NHL. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been extensively evaluated and is now an integral component of many treatment strategies. The activity of rituximab was first shown in the pivotal trial in patients with relapsed and refractory low-grade and follicular lymphoma. More recent studies have shown somewhat higher activity of rituximab when used first-line, with further improvements with maintenance therapy. Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to achieve high response rates, and two prospective randomized studies from the German Low-grade Lymphoma Study Group have shown significantly higher response rates and longer survival for patients receiving rituximab concurrently with chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Further data from ongoing phase III studies are still needed to determine whether rituximab can help alter the natural history of indolent NHL, and longer follow-up of these patients will help determine the optimal role for rituximab in treatment of indolent NHL.

AB  - Risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation was assessed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients with resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive) who received obinutuzumab- or rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy in the phase 3 GOYA and GALLIUM studies. HBV DNA monitoring was undertaken monthly to 1 year after the last dose of study drug. In case of HBV reactivation (confirmed, HBV DNA ++29 IU/mL), immunochemotherapy was withheld and nucleos(t)ide analog treatment (preemptive NAT) started. Immunochemotherapy was restarted if HBV DNA became undetectable or reactivation was not confirmed, and discontinued if HBV DNA exceeded 100 IU/mL on NAT. Prophylactic NAT was allowed by investigator discretion. Among 326 patients with resolved HBV infection, 27 (8.2%) had HBV reactivation, occurring a median of 125 days (interquartile range, 85-331 days) after the first dose. In 232 patients without prophylactic NAT, 25 (10.8%) had HBV reactivation; all received preemptive NAT. Ninety-four patients received prophylactic NAT; 2 (2.1%) had HBV reactivation. No patients developed HBV-related hepatitis. On multivariate Cox analysis, detectable HBV DNA at baseline was strongly associated with an increased risk of reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.04-54.93; P < .0001). Prophylactic NAT was strongly associated with a reduced risk (adjusted HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41; P 5 .0018). HBV DNA monitoring-guided preemptive NAT was effective in preventing HBV-related hepatitis during anti-CD20-containing immunochemotherapy in B-cell NHL patients with resolved HBV infection. Antiviral prophylaxis was also effective and may be appropriate for high-risk patients. These trials were registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01287741 (GOYA) and NCT01332968 (GALLIUM).Copyright Â© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - Nutrition assessment and management of a patient with cancer is complicated by physiologic abnormalities associated with the tumor, adverse effects of cancer treatment, and weight changes that may occur before, during, and/or after treatment. Food intolerances and alterations in metabolism and hypercatabolism affect timely administration of nutrition support. In older patients, it is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, frailty, and cognitive concerns. Few evidence-based guidelines exist to direct nutritional care and evaluation of nutrition outcomes in patients with cancer. A case study of an elderly patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is reviewed, with emphasis on available evidence-based nutrition prevention and support recommendations.

AB  - Background: Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade have separately shown efficacy in some lymphoid malignancies, the safety of allo-SCT after anti-PD-1 therapy in these patients remains a high clinical interest. Aim(s): We present data from an analysis from 4 KEYNOTE phase 1-3 studies to describe predetermined complications in patients who received allo-SCT following pembrolizumab therapy. Method(s): The analysis included patients from the KEYNOTE-013 (NCT01953692, n=20), KEYNOTE-087 (NCT02453594, n=31), KEYNOTE-170 (NCT02576990, n=5), and KEYNOTE-204 (NCT02684292, n=14) trials who have a known allo-SCT transplantation date received within 2 years of the last dose of study pembrolizumab. Descriptive statistics were used for predefined post-allo-SCT complications of interest. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute grade 3-4 GVHD, and chronic GVHD was estimated. The corresponding competing risk events were death without acute grade 2-4 GVHD, death without acute grade 3-4 GVHD, and death without chronic GVHD, respectively. The cumulative incidence of post-allo-SCT transplantrelated mortality (TRM) was estimated with relapse as a competing risk. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventy patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 30 y (range, 18-65), 57 (81.4%) had classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), and the rest had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 69 of 70 (98.6%) patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy; 1 patient received pembrolizumab + lenalidomide. Median duration on study treatment was 5.3 months (range, 0.7-29.6) and median time from last pembrolizumab dose to first allo-SCT was 4.6 months (range, 1-20). Before transplantation, 49 patients (70.0%) had intervening anticancer regimen; 34 (48.6%) had active disease, 31 patients (44.3%) were in remission at time of transplant, and 5 patients (7.1%) had unknown disease status. Overall, 55 patients (78.6%) developed GVHD (acute, 38; chronic, 17). The estimated 6-month post-allo-SCT cumulative incidence was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.30-0.53) for grade II-IV acute GVHD and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.12-0.30) for grade III-IV acute GVHD; 1 year post-allo-SCT was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12-0.31) for chronic GVHD. Other predetermined complications, including critical illness, immune-mediated adverse events, pulmonary complications, and veno-occlusive liver disease, occurred in 32 patients (45.7%). After a median follow-up (defined as the time from allo-SCT to data cutoff) of 40.1 months (range, 5.1-71.2), the post-allo-SCT median PFS was not reached (NR) (95% CI, 14.5-NR) and the 30-month post-allo-SCT PFS rate was 56.8% (95% CI, 42.9-68.5) (Figure A); median OS was NR (95% CI, NR-NR) and the OS rate at 12 months was 82.2% (Figure B). The estimated post-allo-SCT cumulative incidence for TRM at 6 months was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.03-0.17) and for relapse at 26 months was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.16- 0.38). PFS and OS outcomes were comparable in the subgroup of patients with cHL. Summary/Conclusion: The incidence of GVHD in this population is comparable to historical data (40%-80% and 30%-70%, respectively). The incidence of severe acute GVHD may be higher than a typical modern allo-SCT series, although TRM was low. The observed PFS and OS outcomes compare favorably to historical benchmarks (2-year PFS ranging from 45%-48%; 1-year OS >80%). Altogether, this analysis lends confidence that allo-SCT is feasible for patients with lymphoid malignancies after PD-1 blockade. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the results of the diagnostic imaging modalities, especially ultrasonography (US) in children during the oncological therapy with the acute abdominal symptoms. Acute abdominal symptoms in children with neoplasms causing a very difficult clinical and diagnostic problems and can occure in any stage of disease. Materials/Methods: We analyzed 249 ultrasounds examinations of the abdominal cavity in 144 girls and 105 boys aged from 1 to 18 years (mean age 1o, 3 years). The more important indication for the US exam in 133 cases was acute abdominal symptoms. We took exams during pre- and postoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy and after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. All the patients were under routine hematological control. Based on the clinical symptoms and the laboratory tests we analysed two groups of children with oncological disease and acute abdomen: I group-111 children with neutropenia, II group-22 children without neutropenia. In the patients who underwent operation procedure the final diagnosis was established on histopathology. In the other cases diagnosis was based on clinical, laboratory and radiological exams, especially ultrasonography. We analyzed clinical picture of disease, the results of therapy and the US changes in examed patients using statistic parameters as: sensitivity, specificity and efficiency. Result(s): In the group of 133 children with acute abdominal symptoms the most (92-69,1%) patients suffer from ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and 16(12%) - from AML (acute lympoblastic leukaemia), Ewing sarcoma-3(2,2%), osteosarcoma-3(2,2%), NHL-8(6,0%), HL-4(3%), nephroblastoma-4(3%), neuroblastoma-3 (2,2%). Acute abdominal symptoms can have a very different etiology: bacterial, mycotic and virusal infections or continious infiltration of gastrointestinal tract by tumor. Clinical symptoms of the acute abdominal diseases are very severe, because the oncological patients usually have immunologic deficiency and oblige us to proper clinical observation or to operation procedure, very often as an emergency. The symptoms appeard in the different time of course of oncological diseases. Nonspecific gastrointestinal inflammation with haemorrhage and typhlitis were the main cause of the acute abdominal pain in 71 children with neutropenia during therapy of leucaemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The accuracy of ultrasound findings verified intraoperatively and by histopathologic examinations was 84%. In all cases the morphological changes were directly related to the signs and symptoms duration. Conclusion(s): The high-resolution ultrasound has a very important role in diagnosis in all patients with acute abdominal pain and with neoplasms. The authors consider that the US should be the first imaging method in the differential diagnosis of the abdominal changes in children with neutropenia and oncological disease. Proper diagnosis should be established only with clinical information.     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 0.194068009844173     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Thirteen patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma were treated with 131I-Lym-1 during the course of a dose escalation trial. Principal aims were to establish the maximum tolerated single dose (MTD), as well as to assess clinical and dosimetric effects of the MTD. Patients were eligible if >25% of tumor cells bound Lym-1 on immunohistochemistry, stain intensity was +2/4 or greater and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) assay was negative. Radioimmunotherapy was performed with escalating doses at levels of 50 mCi, 65 mCi/m2 and 80 mCi/m2 (50-139 mCi total). Patients were eligible for retreatment after 6-10 weeks if there was no severe toxicity, their disease was at least stable and HAMA remained negative. Three were retreated. Four have achieved partial responses which lasted 11, 11, 18 and 22 weeks. Acute toxicities included rigors (69%), fever (62%), nausea (46%), vomiting (46%), pruritus (23%), urticaria (23%), chest pain (23%) and bronchospasm (15%). HAMA developed in 3 patients. Myelosuppression, manifested as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, was dose-limiting and defined the single dose MTD at 65 mCi/m2. Plasma radioactivity clearance was biphasic, with a 0.9 hr alpha-T( 1/2 ) and a 19.8 hr beta-T( 1/2 ). At completion of Lym-1 infusion, a mean of 45% of the injected dose was recoverable in the circulation. Images obtained within the first 2 hours indicated mean hepatic and splenic uptake was 29% and 11%, respectively. Radiation absorbed doses to tumor ranged from 18-61 rads; mean doses to whole body ranged from 17 to 71 rads.

AB  - Personalized medicine aims to match the right drug with the right patient by using specific features of the individual patient's tumor. However, current strategies of personalized therapy matching provide treatment opportunities for less than 10% of patients with cancer. A promising method may be drug profiling of patient biopsy specimens with single-cell resolution to directly quantify drug effects. We prospectively tested an image-based single-cell functional precision medicine (scFPM) approach to guide treatments in 143 patients with advanced aggressive hematologic cancers. Fifty-six patients (39%) were treated according to scFPM results. At a median follow-up of 23.9 months, 30 patients (54%) demonstrated a clinical benefit of more than 1.3-fold enhanced progression-free survival compared with their previous therapy. Twelve patients (40% of responders) experienced exceptional responses lasting three times longer than expected for their respective disease. We conclude that therapy matching by scFPM is clinically feasible and effective in advanced aggressive hematologic cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first precision medicine trial using a functional assay to instruct n-of-one therapies in oncology. It illustrates that for patients lacking standard therapies, high-content assaybased scFPM can have a significant value in clinical therapy guidance based on functional dependencies of each patient's cancer.Copyright Â©2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Introduction. Marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) represent a heterogeneous group of indolent lymphomas arising from memory B lymphocytes within the marginal zone of the secondary lymphoid follicles. MZLs develop in spleen and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), rarely in lymph nodes. The updated WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms grouped MZLs in three specific subtypes: extranodal MZL (EMZL) or MALT type, splenic MZL (SMZL) and nodal MZL (NMZL). Due to the heterogeneity and rarity of these lymphomas, a risk stratified approach is currently lacking. Our study aims to identify whether integration of several clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters may correlate with the outcome of the different MZL subtypes. Materials and Methods. 19 patients (11 females and 8 males), aged between 38 to 84 years, with diagnosis of MZL, were evaluated. Histological subtypes were represented as follows: 12 patients (63.2%) with EMZL [site distribution: stomach (3), lung (3), parotid gland (3), orbit (2) and skin (1)]; 6 NMZL (31,6%) and 1 SMZL (5,2%). At the time of diagnosis, all patients underwent evaluation of basal parameters: clinical and pathology data (sex, age, stage, IPI, histological subtype, Ki67); blood count, LDH, b2-microglobulin and inflammatory markers (ESR, RCP, D-dimer and ferritin); morphological (ultrasound, CT or MRI) and functional (PET/CT) imaging scans (Table 1). PET/CT scans were performed in 15 out of 19 patients; FDG avidity expressed as SUV max was evaluated and included. In case of multiple lesions with different FDG avidity, the higher SUVmax in the patient was considered for statistical analysis. 15 out of 19 patients underwent standard treatments for MZL (steroids, antibiotics, immunotherapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery). At the end of treatment, reevaluation was performed in 12 of the 15 treated patients. The statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS package. Results. Due to the presence of only one SMZL patient in the whole group, we decided to exclude this subtype and to compare EMZL (12 patients) versus NMZL (6 patients) groups (Table 1). The analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of basal platelets count (147330 vs 259000 cells/mmc, NMZL vs EMZL respectively, p=0.018) and basal SUVmax (3.30 vs 8.28 NMZL vs EMZL respectively, p=0.040). Notably, we found lower ESR values in the NMZL group (6.60 mm/h) compared with the EMZL one (27.00 mm/h) without reaching statistic significance (p=0.100). All the other parameters evaluated did not show significant differences. Conclusions. We found a close correlation between EMZL subtype, level of platelet count and SUVmax. These data suggest that increased PET avidity may depend on marked systemic inflammatory stimuli triggered by EMZL rather than NMZL diseases. Further investigations with an enlarged cohort of patients will be needed to confirm these data and to design an integrated score for risk stratification of MZLs. (Table Presented).

AB  - The prognostic role of TP53 disruption has been established in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Aim of this analysis was to correlate TP53 mutations by Sanger sequencing, cell of origin (COO) profile by Lymph2Cx panel on the NanoString platform and MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 overexpression or re-arrangements by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), with outcome in DLBCL patients enrolled into the FIL-DLCL04 trial (NCT00499018). One hundred and twenty-five DLBCL patients with tumour block available were analyzed. TP53 was mutated in 11/125 (9%) cases; 60/125 patients received high-dose chemoimmunotherapy up-front, as for the randomization arm; COO was reported in 88 patients: 48 germinal centre B-cell like, 25 activated B-cell like and 17 unclassified; 26 patients were double expressors in IHC and 11 double hit in FISH. After a median follow-up of 72âmonths, five-year failure-free survival (FFS) for TP53 mutated versus wild-type was 24% and 72%, and five-year overall survival (OS) was 34% and 83%, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 2Â·28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0Â·89-5Â·86, pâ=â0Â·086] and 4Â·05 (95% CI 1Â·37-11Â·97, pâ=â0Â·011) for FFS and OS, respectively. In this series of young DLBCL patients, TP53 gene mutation identified a poor prognosis subgroup, regardless of treatment and other biological markers.

AB  - Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are frequently used following haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with a high risk of relapse. Limited data are available on the characteristics of GVHD in this setting. The aim of this study is to investigate the NIH type, severity, treatment and response rates of GVHD following DLI. Consecutive patients receiving DLI at 4 transplantation centres in the UK were identified since 2006. Data were collected retrospectively to include diagnosis, date of transplant, dates and doses of DLI, onset of GVHD, treatment of GVHD, follow up (FU) and outcome. 58 patients were identified having received DLI. The mean age at HSCT was 55yrs (median 45, range 20-70). Haematological malignancies were AML in 22, MDS in 9, CML in 7, myeloma in 5, CLL in 5, NHL in 3 and other in 7. 33 received matched related and 25 unrelated donor transplants. The reason cited for DLI was pre-emptive (mixed chimerism) in 30, therapeutic in 28 (relapse in 18, molecular relapse in 6, cytogenetic abnormality in 3 and consolidation in 1). DLI was given at a mean of 14 months after HSCT (median 7, range 1-65). DLI dose ranged from 1x105-1x107 CD3+ cellskg-1. The number of doses ranged from 1-8, mean 2.3, median 2. 43 patients had GVHD after DLI (acute in 16, chronic in 26 and overlap in1). In aGVHD skin was the most common organ involved in 13/16 patients, followed by liver in 7, and gut in 6. 9/16 had single organ involvement (7 skin only, 2 liver only). 3 patients had skin and gut and 4 skin, gut and liver. In 6 patients this was severe (grade III-IV aGVHD). Of the 27 with cGVHD the most common organ involved in decreasing order was skin (n=20), oral (n=16), liver (n=9), eye (n=6), gut (n=4) and lung (n=1). 9 patients had single organ involvement (skin only in 6, oral 2, eye 1). 12 patients had 2, 2 had 3, 2 had 4 and 2 had five organs involved. 8 patients had cGVHD recorded as severe. The mean time between first DLI doses and development of aGVHD was 2 months (median 1, range 1-5 months) and 5.7months (median 3, range 1-28) in cGVHD. First treatment of aGVHD was oral prednisolone in all 16 patients: first treatment response was CR in 4/16, relapse in 4 and progressive GVHD in 8. 5 died (2 from relapse, 2 from aGVHD and 1 from pneumonia). 5 with progressive GVHD received a 2nd line therapy (ECP in 3, tacrolimus in 1 & MMF in 1). 2 patients had a CR, 1 patient relapsed and died, 1 has ongoing mild GVHD and the other had 3rd line therapy with ECP and a PR. The 1st treatment in cGVHD was oral prednisolone in 16/27 (prednisolone alone in 12, plus CyA in 2, tacrolimus in 1, MMF in 1). 9 received topical steroids only, 1 received MMF and 1 rituximab. 16/27 patients had a CR to first line therapy, 1 died of severe lung GVHD and 1 relapsed. 9 received a 2nd line therapy (ECP in 4, MMF in 3, imatinib in 1 and infliximab in 1). 1 had CR, 7 had PR and 1 relapsed. 4 had a 3rd line therapy (ECP in 2 and MMF in 2) of which 1 had CR and 3 PR. I further patient had a 4th therapy with ECP and a PR. Of 8 patients with severe cGVHD 1 had 1 therapy (and died), 4 had 2, 2 had 3 and 1 had 4 therapies: 7/8 are alive, 4 in remission with GVHD, 2 in remission without GVHD and 1 relapsed. Mean FU for cohort is 51.7 months (median 45, range 5-124) post HSCT. 35 are in remission, 11 of whom are receiving treatment for GVHD (4 with severe cGVHD). 18 patients relapsed (7 are receiving treatment and 11 died). In total 16/58 died and causes were relapse (11), severe GVHD (3, 2x aGVHD,1x cGVHD), ruptured aortic aneurysm (1) and pneumonia (1). 7/30 (23%) patients receiving DLI for mixed chimerism died compared to 9/18 (50%) receiving DLI for relapse. Overall survival in those developing aGVHD and cGVHD was 63% and 74% respectively compared to 12/15 (80%) in those without GVHD. Death from relapse was similar in those with and without GVHD post DLI at 20% and 26% respectively and death rates in those with severe GVHD do not appear higher. We report on 58 patients receiving DLI after HSCT. 74% developed GVHD which was severe in 24%. In the majority of patients developing GVHD after DLI successful treatment may be achieved with increased immunosuppression. 39% of patients received second line therapy for GVHD most commonly ECP. 21% received a third line therapy. 16/58 patients have died (28%) including 3 (5%) of GVHD. The most common cause of death was relapse in 19%. In summary patients develop both aGVHD and cGVHD post DLI and may require consecutive therapies but mortality from GVHD is infrequent.

AB  - Plerixafor (P) in combination with filgrastim (F) is currently approved for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). F + P is a very expensive but reduces the incidence of mobilization failure. In an effort to utilize P in a cost efficient manner, we employed a risk adaptive strategy of using P only in patients who are at high risk of mobilization failure defined by peripheral blood CD34+ cell (pCD34) count of < 10/muL after 4 days of F alone. In this study we present the results of efficacy and an estimate of cost of such a risk adaptive strategy for autologous peripheral blood HPC collection. 42 patients with history ofNHL orMMundergoing peripheral blood HPCmobilization fromFebruary toDecember 2009 were included in the analysis. All patients received daily filgrastim for 4 days. Our risk adaptive approach was to add P for those 'at-risk' patients, who on day 4 had a pCD34 count of < 10/muL, with apheresis commencing the following morning. Morning administration of F and evening dosing of P was continued daily in this group of 'at-risk' patients for up to amaximumof 4 days or until. > 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were collected. Results of consecutive patients who had peripheral blood HPC mobilization were prospectively collected. A decision analytic model was created to estimate the mean cost and effectiveness rates in patients who underwent mobilization with F versus F + P. 18 patients were mobilized with F alone and 24 patients required F + P. Administration of P was safe and no severe adverse events were recorded. Addition of P increased the pCD34 count by 6.8 fold with an average total yield of 4.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. The frequency of poor mobilization among F only and F + P patients was 25%and 7% respectively. The pooled average cost benefit for mobilization with F + P may be up to $ 16,900 per patient and could potentially increase the annual number of transplants by more than 18%. Following autologous stem cell infusion, days to neutrophil and platelet engraftments were similar between the patients who mobilized HPC with F versus F + P (p = 0.12). These results suggest that addition of P to F based on a risk adaptive strategy significantly reduces the frequency of mobilization failures and is also cost effective. Addition of P to F forHPC mobilization has no significant impact on the neutrophil and platelet engraftment.

AB  - Introduction The availability of HLA matched donors remains a major obstacle for successful allogeneic hematotopoietic cell transplantation. The use of HLA-mismatched alternate donors such as cord blood and haploidentical donor stem cell sources have allowed for greater access for those patients who need an allo-HSCT but lack a suitable matched sibling or unrelated donor. Introduction of high dose cytoxan in the early post-transplant period has significantly improved the outcomes of patients undergoing haploidentical transplantation and has eliminated the need for expensive and labor-intensive ex-vivo T cell depletion. Encouraging results have been reported using this platform with bone marrow as the source of stem cells. However, there have been only limited reports using this transplant platform with G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a source of stem cells for haloidentical transplantation. Here we report the outcomes of 18 patients who underwent haploidentical transplant for hematological malignancies from single institution treated on the Hopkins non-meloablative conditioning regimen but with G-CSF mobilized PBSC as a source of stem cells from a haplo-identical family donor. Patients and Methods A total of 18 patients (median age 41 years, range 22-73 years, 11 males and 7 females) between July 2009 and June 2013 underwent haploidentical transplant at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis using the Hopkins non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with post transplant cytoxan (fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day on days -6 to -2), cytoxan (14.5 mg/kg/day on days -6 and -5) and TBI (single dose at 200cGy on day -1) and all these patients received two doses of post-transplant cytoxan (50mg/kg on D+3 and D+4). G-CSF mobilized PBSC from parents (n=9) or siblings (9) were used as a graft source with median CD34+ cell dose of 5.0 x 106/kg and median CD3+ T cell dose of 19.7 x 107/kg. GVHD prophylaxis regimen included MMF plus tacrolimus (16/18 patients) or MTX plus tacrolimus (2/18 patients). Median follow-up of all patients was 251 (range 17-1174) days. Diagnoses included AML (n=12), ALL (n=2), NHL (n=2), CLL (n=1) and aplastic anemia (n=1). 7 out of 12 AML patients underwent transplant with active disease (not in remission) and 4/18 of these patients had prior history of allogeneic HCT. Results 16 patients (89%) engrafted (> 95% donor chimerism), median time to neutrophil engraftment was 15 days (range: 12-28 days) and median time to platelet engraftment was 18 days (range: 11-40 days). None of these patients had secondary graft failure. 1-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 62% and 100-day and 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were 11% and 17% respectively. Both 1-year and 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) rates were 53%. Despite very high CD3+ T cell doses, cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 40.7% while grade III-IV aGvHD occurred in only 3 patients (17%). Cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 2 years were both at 8% (extensive in only 1 patient). CMV reactivation occurred in 11 patients (61%) but did not significantly impact their survival or relapse rates and none of these patients developed CMV disease. Conclusions Here we report the outcomes of 18 patients with hematologic malignancies or marrow failure states undergoing haploidentical transplant using the published Hopkins NMA conditioning platform with post-transplant high dose cytoxan and with G-CSF mobilized PBSC as a source of donor stem cells. In spite of the limited numbers of patients transplanted, our results suggest that this approach is both safe and effective and associated with rapid multilineage engraftment, low rates of both aGvHD and cGvHD and encouraging overall and disease-free survival rates and low rates of NRM. Based on these results, 1) G-CSF mobilized PBSC from haploidentical donors should be considered as an alternative source of haploidentical stem cells to BM and 2) future randomized trials using this platform to test the role of haploidential G-CSF mobilized PBSC with other unrelated donor stem cell sources (cord blood and matched unrelated could also be considered in the future. (Figure presented) Over all survival (OS) rates in patients after haploidentical transplantation, with red dotted line showing OS in patients who were in remission at the time of the transplant while the and blue line represents patients with active disease at the time of their transplant.

AB  - Background: High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has become the standard of care for patients with relapsed chemo-sensitive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Various conditioning regimens have been developed to improve outcome, but no regimen has proven superior. We compare the outcomes of Carmustine, Etoposide, Cytarabine, Melphalan (BEAM) used at the Ohio State University to that of Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide (BUCYVP16) used at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Aim(s): To compare the efficacy and toxicity of BEAM and BUCYVP16 conditioning regimens in patients with relapsed NHL undergoing AHSCT. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed patients treated with BEAM (n=269) or BUCYVP16 (n=409) followed by AHSCT between 2006 and 2014. Kaplan- Meier estimates were used to analyze progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was measured from transplant date until relapse, treating deaths as competing risks using Pepe and Mori test. Result(s): Patient characteristics were similar for age (median 60 (20-77) vs 58 (27-78)), disease stage at diagnosis (p=0.29), prior radiation exposure (p=0.68), and response status at transplant (94.7% CR/PR vs 93.2%) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16 respectively. Differences were number of prior treatments (median 2 (1-8) vs 2 (1-13), p<0.01), comorbidity index (74.0% 0-3 vs 80.9%, p=0.03), and median CD34 dose infused (4.3 vs 6.02, p<0.01) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16. Median follow-up from diagnosis and transplant was 6.6 years and 4.0 years respectively for BEAM and 7.0 years and 4.3 years for BUCYVP16. Median day to neutrophil engraftment was 10 (8-19) vs 10 (9-15) (p<0.01) and median time to platelet engraftment was 18 (11-69) vs 16 (3-129) (p<0.01) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16. There were no statistical differences in CIR, PFS or OS. At 1, 3 and 5 years from AHSCT, PFS was 75%, 59%, and 46% vs 72%, 54%, and 44% (p=0.52); OS 88%, 75%, and 66% vs 83%, 69% and 59% (p=0.11) in the BEAM vs BUCYVP16 groups respectively (Figure 1). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was higher in the BEAM group (7 pts (2.6%) compared to none in BYCYVP16 (p<0.01)) but grade 3 or 4 mucositis was lower in BEAM (24.2%) compared to 56.1% in BUCYVP16 (p<0.01). There were no differences in hemorrhagic cystitis or second primary malignancy. Summary/Conclusions: This large retrospective study showed no statistical difference in PFS, OS, or CIR between BEAM and BUCVP16 conditioning regimens for AHSCT in relapsed NHL. Veno-occlusive disease occurred more frequently in the BEAM group, while grade 3 or 4 mucositis occurred more frequently in the BUCYVP16 group. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) dissemination of aggressive lymphoma is a rare and aggressive disorder which may present de novo with concomitant systemic disease or as CNS relapse (isolated or with systemic disease). The majority of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be cured with R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). The most common cause of treatment failure is systemic relapse or progression. However, CNS relapse occurs in 2-6% of all DLBCL patients and is associated with a poor survival of less than six months. Modern risk stratification includes several clinical and biological features. A validated clinical risk model employing the International Prognostic Index risk factors plus adrenal or renal involvement is able to identify a high-risk patient population with an increased risk for CNS recurrence > 10%. Nevertheless, there is little data to inform optimal delivery of CNS prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Recently, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) has increasingly been used in routine clinical practice due to the limited efficacy of intrathecal prophylaxis and the predominant parenchymal site of CNS manifestation. However, this approach is not supported by randomized data. Indication, timing and intensity of HD-MTX delivery differs largely and its efficacy has recently been challenged by results of a large Canadian retrospective study including > 900 patients showing that HD-MTX did not lower the risk of CNS dissemination in DLBCL. Once CNS dissemination has occurred, intensive CNS directed therapy appears to improve overall outcomes compared to systemic therapy alone. Recent data from the largest prospective trial focused on SCNSL patients support this approach by demonstrating durable remission after intensified chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab, cytarabine, thiotepa and rituximab (MATRix) and the non-cross resistant agents ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide with rituximab (R-ICE) followed by thiotepa-based highdose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Importantly, patients with CNS disease at initial diagnosis and patients with CNS dissemination during or after upfront R-CHOP treatment showed different outcomes. This presentation will highlight recent evidence regarding prophylaxis and treatment of CNS involvement of aggressive lymphoma and derive treatment approaches for this heterogeneous subgroup of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The incidence of mucositis caused by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is relatively high. The severe painful mucositis can reduce the quality of life of patients obviously. Transdermal fentanyl is efficient in treating chronic pain of cancer, and also can relieve the severe pain of mucositis resulted from chemotherapy. This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl for the severe painful mucositis caused by AHSCT. METHODS: A total of 22 malignant tumor patients suffered from severe mucositis caused by high dose chemotherapy combined AHSCT. The analgesic degree before and after treatment was evaluated by the scores of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (range 0-10). The median VAS scores of all patients were above 4 (moderate to severe pain) before the administration of transdermal fentanyl. The quality of life before and after treatment was evaluated by the Standard of Quality of Life drew up in China in 1990. The adverse events after treatment were evaluated by Common Toxicity Criteria formulated by National Cancer Institute of the USA. RESULTS: The median VAS score has been decreased from baseline at 6 (4-9) to 3.5 (0-9) on Day 3, 2 (0-6) on Day 5, 0.5 (0-8) on Day 7, 0 (0-6) on Day 10, and 0 (0-5) on Day 15 after treatment (P<0.001). The overall response rate was 100%, while the complete response rate was 45.5%. The quality of life of the patients was improved significantly (P<0.01). The adverse events after treatment of transdermal fentanyl included dizziness, somnolence, dysuria, mild and transient nausea, vomiting, discomfort of stomach, and so on. All the adverse events disappeared within several days after proper managements. Neither severe adverse event nor drug addiction was found. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal fentanyl has good analgesic effect on painful severe mucositis induced by AHSCT. It is convenient and well tolerated, and could improve quality of life significantly.

AB  - PURPOSE: High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with peripheral-blood progenitor cell (PBPC) and autologous bone marrow (ABM) transplant (T) has documented survival benefits for relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Treatment costs associated with HDC and its supportive care have restricted its use both on and off clinical trial. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT resulted in faster recovery of bone marrow function, with less hospitalization and supportive care than ABMT. This study was undertaken to analyze the costs of the two strategies using prospectively collected data from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical results and resource utilization from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT following carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) HDC for HD and NHL are presented. The trial was performed in six centers in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Resource utilization data were used to project costs and Massay Cancer Center (MCC) in the United States incurred the cost of treating the cohort. Costs were projected to the United States, because the economic implications to United States centers are significant, costs of care vary markedly among countries but resource utilization on this trial did not, and a randomized trial is unlikely to be performed in the United States. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients with relapsed HD or NHL underwent HDC with BEAM. The PBPCT and ABMT groups had similar short-term survival after BEAM. PBPCT patients had a shorter hospitalization (median, 17 v 23 days; P = .002), neutrophil recovery (11 v 14 days; P = .005), platelet recovery to > or = 20 x 10(9)/L (16 v 23 days; P = .02), and days of platelet transfusions (6 v 10; P < .001). Estimated costs were $8,531 for ABM harvest and $5,760 for PBPC collection, including filgrastim mobilization. The total estimated average cost was $59,314 for each ABMT patient versus $45,792 for each PBPCT patient. Cost savings of $13,521 (23%) were due to shorter hospitalizations with less supportive care. CONCLUSION: PBPCT is as safe and more effective than ABMT for HD and NHL in the short term. PBPCT represents a significant cost savings due to lower autograft collection costs, shorter hospital stays, and less supportive care. The savings exceed the costs for filgrastim mobilization and PBPC collection. Actual savings will vary depending on local practice patterns, charges, and costs.

AB  - Combined direct antineoplastic activity and the long-lasting immunological effects of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure many hematological malignancies, but broad adoption requires non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) control. Recently, posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) given after a bone marrow transplant significantly reduced GVHD-incidence, while PTCy given with tacrolimus/mofetil mycophenolate (T/MMF) showed activity following allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPB-SCT). Here, we report the experience of a larger cohort (85 consecutive patients) and expanded follow-up period (03/2011-12/2019) with high-risk hematological malignancies who received alloPB-SCT from Human-Leukocyte-Antigens HLA-matched unrelated/related donors. GVHD-prophylaxis was PTCy 50 mg/kg (days+3 and +4) combined with T/MMF (day+5 forward). All patients stopped MMF on day+28 with day+110 = median tacrolimus discontinuation. Cumulative incidences were 12% for acute and 7% for chronic GVHD-and no GVHD-attributed deaths. For surviving patients, the 12, 24, and 36-month probabilities of being off immunosuppression were 92, 96, and 96%, respectively. After a 36-month median follow-up, NRM was 4%; median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) had yet to occur. One-and two-year chronic GVHD-EFS results were 57% (95% CI, 46-68%) and 53% (95% CI, 45-61%), respectively, with limited late infections and long-term organ toxicities. Disease relapse caused the most treatment failures (38% at 2 years), but low transplant toxicity allowed many patients (14/37, 38%) to receive donor lymphocyte infusions as a post-relapse strategy. We confirmed that PTCy+T/MMF treatment effectively prevented acute and chronic GVHD and limited NRM to unprecedented low rates without loss of disease control efficacy in an expanded patient cohort.

AB  - Most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) experience multiple relapses necessitating subsequent lines of therapy. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies, showed promising activity in FL in a phase 1 study. We report the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating ibrutinib in recurrent FL. Forty patients with recurrent FL were treated with ibrutinib 560 mg/d until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Exploratory analyses included correlations of outcome with recurrent mutations identified in a cancer gene panel that used next-generation sequencing in pretreatment biopsies from 31 patients and results of early interim positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans in 20 patients. ORR was 37.5% with a complete response rate of 12.5%, median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14 months, and 2-year PFS of 20.4%. Response rates were significantly higher among patients whose disease was sensitive to rituximab (52.6%) compared with those who were rituximab refractory (16.7%) (P = .04). CARD11 mutations were present in 16% of patients (5 of 31) and predicted resistance to ibrutinib with only wild-type patients responding (P = .002). Maximum standardized uptake value at cycle 1 day 8 correlated with response and PFS. Ibrutinib was well-tolerated with a toxicity profile similar to labeled indications. Ibrutinib is a well-tolerated treatment with modest activity in relapsed FL. Evaluation of BTK inhibitors in earlier lines of therapy may be warranted on the basis of improved response rates in rituximab-sensitive disease. Somatic mutations such as CARD11 may have an impact on response to ibrutinib, may inform clinical decisions, and should be evaluated in larger data sets. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01849263.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pixantrone dimaleate (pixantrone)--a novel aza-anthracenedione--was synthesised to reduce anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity without compromising antitumour efficacy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pixantrone versus an investigator's choice of a single-agent therapy in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial at 66 hospitals in Europe, India, Russia, South America, the UK, and the USA, patients with histologically confirmed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed after two or more previous chemotherapy regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice response system to treatment with pixantrone dimaleate (85 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, for up to six cycles) or to a comparator (vinorelbine, oxaliplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mitoxantrone, or gemcitabine) given at prespecified standard doses and schedules. Patients were stratified by region, International Prognostic Index score, and previous stem-cell transplantation. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment; however, an independent assessment panel was masked. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete or unconfirmed complete response in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population at the end of treatment. Primary analyses of efficacy were based on the independent assessment panel's data review. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00088530. FINDINGS: The ITT population comprised 70 patients randomly assigned to the pixantrone group and 70 to the comparator. Five patients (two in the pixantrone group and three in the comparator group) dropped out before receiving their study drug. 14 patients (20Â·0% [95% CI 11Â·4-31Â·3]) who received pixantrone achieved a complete or unconfirmed complete response at end of treatment compared with four patients (5Â·7% [1Â·6-14Â·0]) in the comparator group (p = 0Â·021). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients given pixantrone were uncomplicated, non-cumulative neutropenia (28 [41Â·2%] of 68 patients vs 13 [19Â·4%] of 67 patients in the comparator group), leucopenia (16 [23Â·5%] vs five [7Â·5%]), and thrombocytopenia (eight [11Â·8%] vs seven [10Â·4%]). INTERPRETATION: Pixantrone, given as a single-agent salvage therapy in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is efficacious and tolerable. It could be a treatment option for patients whose aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma has failed to respond to at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. FUNDING: Cell Therapeutics, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Despite frequent long lasting remissions to first-line treatment, follicular lymphoma of advanced stages is characterized by recurrent relapses. In the randomized PRIMA trial of the GELA, rituximab maintenance achieved prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation in remission after first-line immunochemotherapy (Salles et al., Lancet 2011). The German study groups GLSG and OSHO initiated in 2007 a double randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance versus observation in remission after randomly assigned induction treatment. Method(s): Previously untreated patients with Ann Arbor stage II-IV follicular lymphoma in need of therapy and not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation or curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP, R-MCP, or RFCM. Patients responding to induction treatment were subsequently randomised to 2 years rituximab maintenance or observation, stratified by type of induction treatment, quality of remission, and FLIPI. The trial was initially planned to detect with 95% power a 15% difference in complete remission rates between any of the three induction groups and a PFS hazard ratio of 0.60 by postremission strategy. Result(s): Recruitment was stopped in 2011 after the PRIMA results had been published. Median age of the 206 recruited patients was 66 years (range, 24-86), and FLIPI was low in 13%, intermediate in 28%, and high in 60%. A trend towards higher complete remission rates with R-FCM (43% of 58 patients) compared to R-CHOP (23% of 66) and R-MCP (24% of 66) was observed, but the differences were not statistically significant. High and comparable overall response rates were observed after R-CHOP (88%), R-MCP (89%), and R-FCM (91%). In terms of grade 3-4 leukocytopenia and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, R-FCM (92%, 17%) was more toxic than R-MCP (88%, 6%) which was more toxic than R-CHOP (63%, 3%); R-CHOP showed more frequent neurological toxicities (40%) compared with R-MCP (14%) and R-FCM (16%). Rituximab maintenance substantially prolonged progression-free survival in comparison to observation in remission (hazard ratio 0.39, p = 0.0064). In the rituximab maintenance group, 3-years PFS was 89% (8 PFS events among 65 patients) compared with 69% in the observation group (19 events among 63 patients). With 11 events, no differences in overall survival could be observed for maintenance vs. observation (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.32-3.43, p = 0.95). Rituximab maintenance was more toxic with regards to leukocytes and the gastro-intestinal tract. Conclusion(s): In this randomized trial, 2 years rituximab maintenance was associated with substantially prolonged PFS in comparison to observation after response to first-line immunochemotherapy in follicular lymphoma. Our data represent an independent confirmation of the GELA PRIMA trial results.

AB  - Background: Benefits of cord blood transplantation include low rates of relapse and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the use of cord blood is rapidly declining because of the high incidence of infections, severe acute GVHD, and transplant-related mortality. UM171, a haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal agonist, has been shown to expand cord blood stem cells and enhance multilineage blood cell reconstitution in mice. We aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation in patients with haematological malignancies who do not have a suitable HLA-matched donor. Method(s): This single-arm, open-label, phase 1-2 safety and feasibility study was done at two hospitals in Canada. The study had two parts. In part 1, patients received two cord blood units (one expanded with UM171 and one unmanipulated cord blood) until UM171-expanded cord blood demonstrated engraftment. Once engraftment was documented we initiated part 2, reported here, in which patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood unit with a dose de-escalation design to determine the minimal cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. Eligible patients were aged 3-64 years, weighed 12 kg or more, had a haematological malignancy with an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and did not have a suitable HLA-matched donor, and a had a Karnofsky performance status score of 70% or more. Five clinical sites were planned to participate in the study; however, only two study sites opened, both of which only treated adult patients, thus no paediatric patients (aged <18 years) were recruited. Patients aged younger than 50 years without comorbidities received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, fludarabine 75 mg/m2, and 12 Gy total body irradiation) and patients aged older than 50 years and those with comorbidities received a less myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m2, and 4 Gy total body irradiation). Patients were infused with the 7-day UM171-expanded CD34-positive cells and the lymphocyte-containing CD34-negative fraction. The primary endpoints were feasibility of UM171 expansion, safety of the transplant, kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution (time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment) of UM171-expanded cord blood, and minimal pre-expansion cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. We analysed feasibility in all enrolled patients and all other primary outcomes were analysed per protocol, in all patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. This trial has been completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02668315. Finding(s): Between Feb 17, 2016, and Nov 11, 2018, we enrolled 27 patients, four of whom received two cord blood units for safety purposes in part 1 of the study. 23 patients were subsequently enrolled in part 2 to receive a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplant and 22 patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. At data cutoff (Dec 31, 2018), median follow-up was 18 months (IQR 12-22). The minimal cord blood unit cell dose at thaw that achieved prompt engraftment as a single cord transplant after UM171 expansion was 0.52 x 105 CD34-positive cells. We successfully expanded 26 (96%) of 27 cord blood units with UM171. Among the 22 patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation, median time to engraftment of 100 neutrophils per muL was 9.5 days (IQR 8-12), median time to engraftment of 500 neutrophils per muL was 18 days (12.5-20.0), and no graft failure occurred. Median time to platelet recovery was 42 days (IQR 35-47). The most common non-haematological adverse events were grade 3 febrile neutropenia (16 [73%] of 22 patients) and bacteraemia (nine [41%]). No unexpected adverse events were observed. One (5%) of 22 patients died due to treatment-related diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Interpretation(s): Our preliminary findings suggest that UM171 cord blood stem cell expansion is feasible, safe, and allows for the use of small single cords without compromising engraftment. UM171-expanded cord blood might have the potential to overcome the disadvantages of other cord blood transplants while maintaining the benefits of low risk of chronic GVHD and relapse, and warrants further investigation in randomised trials.

AB  - In a blinded retrospective economic evaluation of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial, total utilisation and charges for lymphoid cancer patients who received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) or placebo were compared following autologous bone marrow transplantation. The 40 patients enrolled (22 rhGM-CSF, 18 placebo) could have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease, be of any age, and were undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation in a metropolitan cancer research centre. Main outcome measures consisted of initial hospital lengths of stay (LOS), total and department charges, rehospitalisation rates and charges, and outpatient charges, all inclusive of the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion. The perspective of the study is that of the third party payer. Initial hospitalisation charges were $US54 100 for patients who received rhGM-CSF and $US68 600 for patients who received placebo (p = 0.05). The difference of $US14 500 was 21% less in patients who received rhGM-CSF, mainly due to lower average LOS with rhGM-CSF (24.2 days) compared with placebo (30.8 days). Outpatient charges were $US9500 (rhGM-CSF) and $US6800 (placebo) {p = 0.18}. Total charges, including readmission (10 per group) were $US12 200 lower in the rhGM-CSF group ($US70 300 vs $US82 500, p = 0.19). The use of rhGM-CSF after autologous bone marrow transplantation was shown to result in substantial cost savings during the initial hospitalisation. When comparing total inpatient and outpatient medical charges within the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion, we found no evidence that these savings were negated.

AB  - Background. Autologous transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) results in faster haematopoietic-cell repopulation than with bone marrow. We prospectively compared bone marrow and PBSC for allogeneic transplantation. Methods. Adult HLA-identical sibling donors provided bone marrow and lenograstim-mobilised PBSC. 39 patients with malignant haematological disorders were infused with either bone marrow (n = 19) or PBSC (n = 20) after standard conditioning regimens in a double-blind, randomised fashion. The identity of the infused products for all patients remained masked until 1 year after the last patient had received transplantation. Findings. The PBSC group had significantly faster neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 109/L (median 17.5 vs 23 days, p = 0.002), and platelet recovery to 20 x 109/L (median 11 vs 18 days, p < 0.0001) and to 50 x 109/L (median 20.5 vs 27 days, p = 0.02) than the bone-marrow group. PBS0 patients were discharged from hospital earlier than were bone-marrow patients (median 26 vs 31 days, p = 0.01). At 4 weeks after transplantation, absolute lymphocytes (0.48 vs 0.63, p = 0.08) and CD25 cells (0.04 vs 0.08, p = 0.007) were higher in the PBSC group, and the proportion of patients with absolute lymphopenia (74% vs 33%, p = 0.03) and CD4 lymphopenia (59% vs 24%, p = 0.05) was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of acute or chronic graft-versus host disease and overall survival. The probability of relapse was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group than in the PBSC group (p = 0.01); all five relapses occurred among bone-marrow recipients. Interpretation. Our small study indicates that PBSCs are better than bone marrow for allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical siblings in terms of faster haematopoietic and immune recovery, and have the potential to reduce disease recurrence.

AB  - This trial is designed as an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, treatment optimisation study, preceded by safety run-in phases conducted for B-cell and T-cell lymphoma separately. Aim of the phase-III trial is to test whether prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodg-kin Lymphoma not eligible for neither autologous nor alloge-neic stem cell transplantation can be improved by combining nivolumab with (R)-GemOx. Population: All patients with frst relapse or progression of an aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma aged older than 65 years or older than 18 years with HCT-CI score > 2 are eligible for this study irrespective of their gender or stage of disease. Tere is no upper limit of age. Also patients not eligible for neither autologous nor allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible for this study. Primary objective: Improvement of 1-yr PFS by nivolumab plus (R)-GemOx followed by nivolumab consolidation instead of (R)-GemOx alone. Primary endpoint is 1-yrs progression-free survival.

AB  - Background: Initial results from the ongoing GALLIUM trial have shown that patients with follicular lymphoma have a longer progression-free survival after first-line immunochemotherapy with obinutuzumab than with rituximab. The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the prognostic value of PET-CT responses after first-line immunochemotherapy in the GALLIUM study. Method(s): GALLIUM is an open-label, parallel-group randomised, phase 3 trial, which recruited previously untreated patients with CD20-positive follicular lymphoma (grades 1-3a; disease stage III/IV, or stage II with largest tumour diameter >=7 cm) who were aged 18 years or older and met the criteria for needing treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous administration of obinutuzumab (1000 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of subsequent cycles) or rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle), in six 21-day cycles with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (known as CHOP; oral administration) followed by two 21-day cycles of antibody alone, or eight 21-day cycles cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (known as CVP; oral administration), or six 28-day cycles with bendamustine, followed by maintenance antibody every 2 months for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint of the trial, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, has been reported previously. This secondary analysis reports PET and CT-based responses at end-of-induction therapy and explains their relation with progression-free and overall survival outcomes in patients with available scans. As per protocol, during the trial, PET scans (mandatory in the first 170 patients enrolled at sites with available PET facilities, and optional thereafter), acquired at baseline and end of induction (PET population), were assessed prospectively by investigators and an independent review committee (IRC) applying International Harmonisation Project (IHP) 2007 response criteria, and retrospectively by the IRC only applying current Lugano 2014 response criteria. IRC members (but not study investigators) were masked to treatment and clinical outcome when assessing response. The landmark analyses excluded patients who died or progressed (contrast enhanced CT-based assessment of progressive disease, or started next anti-lymphoma treatment) before or at end of induction. GALLIUM is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01332968. Finding(s): 1202 patients were enrolled in GALLIUM between July 6, 2011, and Feb 4, 2014, of whom 595 were included in the PET population; 533 (IHP 2007; prospective analysis), and 508 (Lugano 2014; retrospective analysis) were analysed for progression-free survival (landmark analysis). At end of induction, 390 of 595 patients (65.5% [95% CI 61.6-69.4]) achieved PET complete response according to IHP 2007 criteria, and 450 (75.6% [95% CI 72.0-79.0]) obtained PET complete metabolic response according to Lugano 2014 criteria. With a median of 43.3 months of observation (IQR 36.2-51.8), 2.5-year progression-free survival from end of induction was 87.8% (95% CI 83.9-90.8) in PET complete responders and 72.0% (63.1-79.0) in non-complete responders according to IRC-assessed IHP 2007 criteria (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6, p<0.0001). According to Lugano 2014 criteria, 2.5-year progression-free survival in complete metabolic responders was 87.4% (95% CI 83.7-90.2) and in non-complete metabolic responders was 54.9% (40.5-67.3; HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.3, p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Our results suggest that PET is a better imaging modality than contrast-enhanced CT for response assessment after first-line immunochemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma. PET assessment according to Lugano 2014 response criteria provides a platform for investigation of response-adapted therapeutic approaches. Additional supportive data are welcomed.

AB  - The cost-effectiveness of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) compared with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Morbus Hodgkin (MH) was assessed. Costs were determined from the induction chemotherapy regimen up to 3 months after discharge from hospital following the transplantation. Quality of life was measured by the EuroQol, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and the SF-36. Patients were randomised according to a 2:1 ratio to undergo either PBSCT or ABMT. 62 patients underwent PBSCT and 29 ABMT. Costs of the transplantation period were significantly lower in the PBSCT group (15008 Euros) than in the ABMT group (19000 Euros). Significant differences in quality of life were all in favour of PBSCT and emerged using the RSCL, both on 14 days after the transplantation and three months after discharge. We conclude that PBSCT is associated with lower costs and a better quality of life than ABMT for patients with refractory or relapsed NHL or MH.

AB  - Background: Fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab is frequently used in patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas who relapse after alkylating chemotherapy. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rituximab with bendamustine or fludarabine in patients with relapsed, indolent, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mantle-cell lymphoma. Method(s): For this randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 55 centres in Germany, who were subsequently randomised centrally according to prespecified randomisation lists with permuted blocks of randomly variable block size to rituximab (375 mg/m2, day 1) plus either bendamustine (90 mg/m2, days 1 and 2) or fludarabine (25 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 28 days for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Patients were aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 0-2 and had relapsed or refractory indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma; patients refractory to regimens that included rituximab, bendamustine, or purine analogue drugs were excluded. Patients were stratified by histological subtypes of lymphoma and by their latest previous therapies. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and the final analysis was completed per protocol. Non-inferiority of bendamustine plus rituximab versus fludarabine plus rituximab was defined as a difference of less than 15% in 1-year progression-free survival. The protocol was amended in July, 2006, after approval of rituximab maintenance (375 mg/m2 every 3 months for up to 2 years), which was then given to patients achieving a response to either trial treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01456351 (closed to enrolment, follow-up is ongoing). Finding(s): Between Oct 8, 2003, and Aug 5, 2010, we randomly assigned 230 patients to treatment groups (116 bendamustine plus rituximab, 114 fludarabine plus rituximab). 11 patients were excluded for protocol violations and were not followed up further (two in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and nine in the fludarabine plus rituximab group). Thus, 219 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis (114 bendamustine plus rituximab, 105 fludarabine plus rituximab). 1-year progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.84) and 0.48 (0.39-0.58) with fludarabine plus rituximab (non-inferiority p<0.0001). At a median follow-up of 96 months (IQR 73.2-112.9), median progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 34.2 months (95% CI 23.5-52.7) and 11.7 months (8.0-16.1) with fludarabine plus rituximab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54 [95% CI 0.38-0.72], log-rank test p<0.0001). Safety outcomes were similar in both groups, with 46 serious adverse events recorded (23 in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and 23 in the fludarabine plus rituximab group), most commonly myelosuppression and infections. Interpretation(s): In combination with rituximab, bendamustine was more effective than fludarabine, suggesting that bendamustine plus rituximab may be the preferred treatment option for patients with relapsed indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas.

AB  - Karl S Peggs and Sarah J Albon contributed equally to the work and are joint first author Introduction Alemtuzumab reduces the incidence of GVHD after unrelated donor stem cell transplant (MUD SCT) but delays immune reconstitution resulting in high morbidity/mortality from viral infections. Previous studies have suggested that adoptive transfer of allodepleted donor T cells (ADTs) improves immunity after SCT but this has never been tested in a randomised study. We developed a methodology for selective immunomagnetic depletion of alloreactive T-cells upregulating CD25 and CD71 after activation with host dendritic cells (DC) and showed that ADTs retain anti-viral responses with minimal host alloreactivity (Samarasinghe et al Blood 2010). We have now tested whether ADTs can safely be used to improve immune reconstitution after MUD SCT for haematological malignancies in a randomised Phase II multi-centre clinical study; ICAT (NCT01827579). Methods Patients undergoing Alemtuzumab-based peripheral blood SCT from a 9/10 or 10/10 MUD for haematological malignancy were randomised 2:1 to receive either the ATIMP (ADTs) or standard of care. Two weeks prior to SCT, patients randomised to ATIMP underwent a leucapheresis from which DCs were generated. Irradiated patient-derived DCs were then co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from an unstimulated leucapheresis/500ml blood draw from the donor to activate alloreactive T cells. Four days later, the co-culture was depleted of CD25+ and CD71+ fractions by immunomagnetic depletion on the CliniMACs, sampled for residual alloreactivity and sterility, and cryopreserved. Patients randomised to the ATIMP were scheduled to receive 3 escalating doses of ADTs (0.1x106/Kg at day 30, 0.3x106/Kg at day 60 and 1x106/Kg at day 90 post-SCT) until either there was >grade 1 aGVHD or they had normal circulating T cells (>700/microL). The primary end-point of the study was circulating CD3+ T cell count at 4 months post-SCT with one-sided 15% significance level. Acute/chronic GVHD were graded using the Seattle/NIH criteria respectively. Results Twenty one patients were treated, 13 on the ATIMP arm and 8 on the control arm. The median age was 53 years and 67% (14) were male. 12 were AML/Myelodysplasia, 5 NHL, 3 CLL/CML and 1 HL. The median follow-up time is 14 months. Five of 13 ATIMP patients received 1 dose of ADTs, 4/13 2 doses and 4/13 all 3 doses. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was comparable between the arms. Overall, 7/13 ATIMP patients developed significant (>Grade 2) acute GVHD compared to 4/8 of the control arm (p>0.99). 3/13 patients in the ATIMP arm and 2/8 patients in the control arm developed severe aGVHD (all Grade 3). Three of 13 ATIMP cohort patients developed chronic GVHD (1 mild, 1 moderate, 1 severe), compared to 3/8 (all mild) in the control cohort. At 4 months, the circulating CD3+ T cell count mean was 730/microL (range 10-4080) in the ATIMP group and 212.5/microL (range 10-500) in the control group (1-sided p=0.11). However, the data was not normally distributed (Wilcoxon 1-sided p=0.18). Three ATIMP patients had high CD3+ T cell count at 4 months (>1000/microL). At 6 months, the mean circulating CD3+ T cell count was 833.6/microL (range 20-2690) and 327.5/microL (range 10-860). At month 4, the mean PHA stimulation index in the ATIMP arm was 16.8 (range 0.67- 73.1) vs 3.8 (range 1.1-8.2) in the control group. At 4 and 6 months post-SCT, spectratyping analysis showed no evidence of a difference in Vbeta diversity between the 2 arms in both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The 1-year survival rate in the ATIMP cohort is 92% vs 88% in the control, and 1-year disease free survival rate 67% in the ATIMP cohort vs 70% in the control. Conclusions These data suggest that adoptive transfer of ADTs improves T cell reconstitution in some patients after MUD SCT and that the GVHD rates were similar between ATIMP and control groups.

AB  - Background CD20 is a cell surface antigen commonly expressed on B-cell lineage, but is absent on hematopoietic stem cells and plasma cells. Therefore, it has been postulated that its targeting should not significantly affect immunoglobulin serum concentrations. However, due to rapid and prolonged B-cell depletion, rituximab-based therapy has been shown to impair humoral response. In addition, protective serologic response to influenza vaccination in lymphoma patients in the 6 months following rituximab-containing regimen has been found to be particularly low1. Because the vast majority of adults individuals have been previously vaccinated against tetanus, we decided to analyse the impact of prolonged rituximab-based therapy on the immune protection rate against tetanus toxin in patients, and conducted in this aim a sub-analysis in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients treated into the PRIMA study Methods The PRIMA study is a multicentre, phase III, randomized study in patients with advanced FL evaluating the benefit of maintenance therapy with rituximab after induction of response with chemotherapy plus rituximab in comparison with no maintenance therapy, whose results have been previously published2. In a subset of patients, serum samples were prospectively collected and antitetanus toxin antibodies were measured at baseline, end of immunochemotherapy induction and end of maintenance period. Protective titer was defined as > 0.1 UI/mL according to standards. Statistical analysis aimed to determine if serum antitetanus antibodies titers significantly changed over time according to different phases of treatment, and if rituximab maintenance arm had a significant impact as compared to observation arm Results Overall, 104 patients were evaluable for this subanalysis. Fifty-five percent were male. Median age was 57 (range, 27-80), 88.5% had Ann-Arbor stage III-IV disease. All patients had received R-CHOP induction. Among those patients, 56 were randomised into rituximab arm, 48 into observation arm. At baseline, median serum antitetanus antibodies titers in the overall population was 0.8 UI/mL (range, 0-8) and 89.4% of patients had protective titers. At the end of induction, among the 70 evaluable subjects, 90% had still a protective titer with a median of 0.7 UI/mL (range, 0-4), and at the end of maintenance period, among the 62 evaluable patients, 93% had still protective titer with a median of 0.8 (range, 0-3). When comparing the two arms, at the end of maintenance period, median serum antitetanus antibodies titer was 0.8 UI/mL in the rituximab arm, not significantly different from that in the observation arm (0.6 UI/mL) (p=0.17). At the end of the maintenance period, 100% of subjects had still protective titer in the rituximab arm versus 84.6% in the observation arm Conclusion In this subanalysis of 104 FL treated patients issued from the PRIMA study, rituximab-based induction and maintenance therapy did not significantly affect the immunisation rate against tetanus toxin in previously immunized patients. These results are in contrast with the poor serologic response rate obtained following rituximab-based therapy, emphasizing that common serum vaccinal titers should be controlled, and vaccination updated, when possible, before treatment initiation and the first rituximab administration.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine in a randomised trial whether there is any significant difference in toxicity between modified CHOP and MCOP chemotherapy in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and to determine whether this reduced dose chemotherapy can be administered with full dose intensity, low toxicity and produce acceptable survival. Patients and Methods: Between 1993 and 2000, 155 eligible patients were randomised into this trial mainly from three centres (Nottingham, Birmingham and Leeds, UK). The patients were newly diagnosed with aggressive NHL and had a median age of 74 years (range 65-91 years). Ninety-six patients (62%) had bulky stage I or II disease; 59 patients (38%) had either stage III or IV disease; 77% had one or more extranodal sites involved at presentation; and 31% showed B symptoms. Seventy-seven patients were randomised to receive six cycles of modified CHOP (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 i.v., doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 i.v., vincristine 1 mg i.v. all on day 1 with prednisolone 20 mg bd for days 1-5) every 21 days and 78 patients to MCOP (mitozantrone 10 mg/m2 i.v. substituted for doxorubicin). Growth factors were not used routinely. After completion of chemotherapy, 39 patients received involved field radiotherapy (35-40 Gy) in 20 fractions. Result(s): One hundred and one patients (65%) completed all six cycles of chemotherapy. The median course dose intensity was 97%. The median follow-up for 53 surviving patients was 51 months. The median survival was 19 months (95% confidence interval 10-36 months) with an actuarial survival of 47% at 2 years and 42% at 3 years (CHOP versus MCOP, P = 0.79). There was no significant difference in any of the toxicities experienced with either CHOP or MCOP, except for white cell count (46 patients on MCOP and 27 patients on CHOP had grade 3 or 4 toxicity, P = 0.002) and red cell transfusion (37 patients, MCOP; 17 patients, CHOP; P = 0.001). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was documented in 75 patients (50%). One patient died from toxicity whilst in remission and seven patients died with septicaemia and persistent NHL. Conclusion(s): This multicentre randomised trial provides further information on the dose intensity achievable with CHOP or MCOP regimens in elderly patients (median age 74 years) with aggressive NHL. These dose-reduced regimens can be given with nearly 100% dose intensity with 65% of patients completing all the treatment. Survival is comparable to that observed with the more intensive regimens given in this age group.

AB  - PIX306 was a phase 3, randomised, single-blind, multicentre trial conducted in adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3 who relapsed after >=1 rituximab-containing regimen and were not eligible for a stem cell transplant. Patients were randomised 1:1 to pixantrone 50 mg/m2 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, combined with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, for up to six cycles. Patients were followed for up to 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), complete response (CR) rate, overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Overall, 312 patients were randomised (median age 73.0 years). The study did not meet its primary endpoint. Median PFS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 7.3 months (5.2-8.4) with pixantrone + rituximab (PIX + R) and 6.3 months (4.4-8.1) with gemcitabine + rituximab [GEM + R; hazard ratio (HR): 0.85; 95% CI 0.64-1.14; P = 0.28]. Median OS was 13.3 (10.1-19.8) months with PIX + R and 19.6 (12.4-31.9) months with GEM + R (HR: 1.13; 95% CI 0.83-1.53). ORR was 61.9% and 43.9% respectively and CR rate 35.5% and 21.7%. The incidence of adverse events, including cardiac events, was not statistically significant different between PIX + R and GEM + R.Copyright Â© 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a distinct sub-group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas which the Working Formulation categorises as high grade malignancy. It is characterised at diagnosis by frequent mediastinal involvement. However, bone marrow and subsequent peripheral blood involvement are common. From a histologic and cytologic point of view it is identical to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Sequential chemotherapy has improved the prognosis of this lymphoma in terms of survival and disease free survival (DFS). However, there are a series of negative prognostic factors present at diagnosis which seem to reduce survival and DFS due to the high risk of relapse. For this reason, small groups of patients in complete remission were treated with high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) after conventional chemotherapy. An international randomised study is at present underway to determine the usefulness of ABMT for patients responding to front line therapy.

AB  - In this second part of the review the clinical significance of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) as treatment for acute leukemias (AL) and malignant lymphomas is described. In most adult patients with AL in complete remission treated with conventional maintenance therapy relapse usually occurs within one year. However, the results of ABMT, as an intensive consolidation treatment in patients with AL in remission show long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of 40% of patients. Even better results have been reported in patients with purged bone marrow, although the difference is not statistically significant. A major problem of ABMT is still the high percentage of relapse (50%), while the probability of treatment related mortality is relatively low (up to 10%). ABMT is also showing good results in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of intermediate and high-grade histology and in Hodgkin's disease in cases refractory to the first line therapy and in sensitive relapse. However, in refractory cases the results are poor. It is noteworthy, that in all disorders treated with ABMT, prospective randomised controlled trials are missing and current data are based on heterogenous groups of patients. In the majority of solid tumors, even escalated doses of radiochemotherapy with ABMT are not able to eradicate malignant disease. In contrast, the results are very good in neuroblastoma. Although ABMT is a relatively complex and aggressive method, it is being increasingly applied to the treatment of haematological malignant diseases and the results obtained so far, are encouraging and showing that ABMT, besides allogeneic BMT, represents a promising potentially curative treatment for selected group of patients.

AB  - Background: Polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting the CD79b component of the B-cell receptor, has demonstrated activity as a single agent and in combination with rituximab in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this study, we evaluated the safety and preliminary activity of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Method(s): This was an open-label, non-randomised study composed of a phase 1b dose escalation and a phase 2 dose expansion at 11 hospitals and health centres in the USA and France. Patients aged 18 years or older with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were eligible. Exclusion criteria included peripheral neuropathy with grade greater than 1, major surgery within 4 weeks before enrolment, known CNS involvement of lymphoma, and uncontrolled heart disease. Phase 1b dose escalation had a three-plus-three design and established the recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 expansion evaluated the recommended phase 2 dose of polatuzumab vedotin in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with an International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2-5. Patients received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle orally (CHP), plus either rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of each cycle (R-CHP) or obinutuzumab 1000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of the following cycles (G-CHP). Polatuzumab vedotin was administered on day 2 of cycles 1 and 2, and on day 1 of the following cycles at 1.0-2.4 mg/kg during the escalation phase and at the recommended phase 2 dose during the expansion phase. Treatment could last six or eight cycles, depending on investigator preference. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and tolerability, and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (or recommended phase 2 dose) of polatuzumab vedotin. All endpoints were analysed per protocol in the safety evaluable population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992653. Finding(s): Between Dec 4, 2013, and July 26, 2016, 85 patients were enrolled. 82 patients were included in the safety and activity evaluable populations, 25 in phase 1b and 57 in phase 2. In light of information from other studies using polatuzumab vedotin reported during this study, in which the safety profile associated with exposure to polatuzumab vedotin at doses higher than 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks was not outweighed by any clinical benefit, the recommended phase 2 dose was set to 1.8 mg/kg in the R-CHP cohort and no higher doses were explored in this study. 66 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received the polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose (45 R-CHP; 21 G-CHP). In 66 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2 dose, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (20 [30%]), febrile neutropenia (12 [18%]), and thrombocytopenia (six [9%]). Among the 70 patients (any histology) who received the recommended phase 2 dose, 19 (27%) had grade 1 peripheral neuropathy, eight (11%) grade 2, and two (3%) grade 3. Four deaths were reported during follow-up: two treatment-related (one complication of atrial fibrillation and one septic shock) and two due to disease progression. As of the cutoff date of Dec 29, 2017, median follow-up time was 21.5 months (IQR 16.7-24.3) for the untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort treated at the polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose. 59 (89%) patients achieved an overall response at end of treatment (51 [77%] patients had a complete response, and eight [12%] patients had a partial response). Interpretation(s): The safety of incorporating polatuzumab vedotin to R-CHP or G-CHP was as expected and managable. Preliminary clinical activity in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma seems promising and encouraged a phase 3 trial comparing polatuzumab vedotin with R-CHP to R-CHOP.

AB  - Background: Over 12,000 new cases of B-cell malignancies are diagnosed in the UK each year, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) being the most common subtypes. Standard frontline therapy consists of immunochemotherapy with a CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), such as rituximab, delivered in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Despite being considered a treatable and potentially curable cancer, approximately 30% of DLBCL cases will relapse after frontline therapy. Advanced stage FL is incurable and typically has a relapsing and remitting course with a frequent need for re-treatment. Based on supportive preclinical data, we hypothesised that the addition of varlilumab (an anti-CD27 mAb) to rituximab (an anti-CD20 mAb) can improve the rate, depth and duration of the response of rituximab monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Methods/design: Combination treatment of varlilumab plus rituximab, in two different dosing regimens, is being tested in the RIVA trial. RIVA is a two-stage open-label randomised phase IIa design in up to 40 patients with low- or high-grade relapsed or refractory CD20+ B-cell lymphoma. The study is open to recruitment in the UK. Enrolled patients are randomised 1:1 to two different experimental varlilumab to rituximab combinations. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination and the anti-tumour activity (response) in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Secondary objectives will include an evaluation of the duration of the response and overall survival. Tertiary translational objectives include assessment of B-cell depletion, changes in immune effector cell populations, expression of CD27 as a biomarker of response and pharmacokinetic properties. Analyses will not be powered for formal statistical comparisons between treatment arms. Discussion(s): RIVA will determine whether the combination of rituximab and varlilumab in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies is active and safe prior to future phase II/III trials.

AB  - Despite the greater risk of adverse COVIDâ19 outcomes, antibody and cellâmediated immune responses to COVIDâ19 vaccines vary amongst immunocompromised (IC) people and are poorly defined. IC hosts were largely excluded from the COVIDâ19 vaccine registration trials, though many countries recommend additional and booster doses of vaccination in this group. However, data are heterogeneous, in part due the variable nature of immunodeficiencies in IC groups and nonâstandardised outcome measures used in studies. BOOSTâIC is an adaptive randomised clinical trial (RCT) to assess the immunogenicity and safety of additional COVIDâ19 vaccine doses in immunocompromised (IC) people, including people with HIV, solid organ transplants (SOT) recipients or those with haematological malignancies. Briefly, the study aims to generate highâquality evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of alternative COVIDâ19 booster strategies against SARSâCoVâ2 for IC people in Australia. To do this, participants who have previously completed 3â to 5âdoses of Australian TGA approved COVIDâ19 vaccine (mRNA, ChAdOxâ1, Novavax) will be randomised 1:1:1 to one of 3 arms of vaccine boosting, namely: (i) single dose Pfizer, (ii) single dose Moderna or (iii) single dose Novavax. Participants who have undetectable antiâspike SARSâCoVâ2 IgG antibodies after 28 days (i.e. seronegative) will be secondarily randomised to an additional booster dose of COVIDâ19 vaccine. Patients will be followed up for 455 days post randomisation. Specific study questions pertain to: â examining how additional doses of COVIDâ19 vaccine/s affect correlates of protective immunity â examining the safety of additional doses of COVIDâ19 vaccine/s â characterising the humoral and cellular immune responses to COVIDâ19 vaccination receiving 1 or 2 booster doses of COVIDâ19 vaccine/s     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 2.3694698766801263     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Mosunetuzumab (M), a CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody, has demonstrated high and consistent response rates in high-risk relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) patients (pts), with early evidence of a favourable benefit/risk profile. Lenalidomide (Len) is clinically active in FL pts. M + Len offers potentially additive/ synergistic efficacy via potent immunomodulatory activity. We present data from an ongoing Phase Ib study (NCT04246086) evaluating safety and activity of M + Len in R/R FL pts. Pts with R/R FL (Grade [Gr] 1-3a) and >=1 prior systemic anti-cancer therapy were enrolled to receive 12 cycles of M + Len (Cycle [C]1 duration: 21 days; C2-12: 28 days). In C1, step-up doses of M (intravenous [IV] infusion) were given on Day (D)1 (1 mg), and D8 (2mg), with the target dose (30 mg) given on C1D15 and on D1 of C2-12. Len (20 mg) was administered orally on D1-21 of C2-12. No hospitalisation was mandated. Primary objective: to evaluate M + Len safety. Secondary objective: to assess response and long-term efficacy outcomes. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria, responses were assessed with PET-CT using standard criteria. At data cut-off (31 May 2021) 27 pts were enrolled. The median age was 59 years (range: 31-79 years), 12 pts (44%) were male and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (18 pts, 67%) or 1 (9 pts, 33%). The median number of prior therapy lines was 1 (1-4); three pts (11%) had disease progression (PD) <24 months (m) from the start of first-line therapy. Sixteen pts (59%) had been on study for 0-3 m, 8 (30%) for 3-6 m, 2 (7%) for 6-9 m and 1 for >9 m. Twenty pts (74%) experienced >=1 adverse event (AE) of any Gr. The most common AE was CRS (8 pts, 30%). Gr3-4 AEs and serious AEs occurred in eight pts (30%) each. There were no Gr5 AEs. AEs relating to M and Len occurred in 20 (74%) and 10 pts (37%) respectively. No AEs led to the withdrawal of M or Len; two pts had M-related AEs leading to M dose delays, six pts (22%) had Len-related AEs leading to Len dose interruption and/or reduction. CRS events were Gr1 (7/8 pts) or Gr2 (1/8 pts). Six out of eight pts experienced CRS events in C1D1-7; two out of eight had Gr1 CRS events in C2. The median time to CRS onset was 1 day after the first dose (1-28 days); median duration was 3 days (2-5 days). All CRS events were resolved without sequelae. No pts required tocilizumab, ICU admission, high flow oxygen, or vasopressor support. Five pts (19%) reported 14 events of Gr3-4 neutropenia between D41 and 218, lasting 6-16 days, all resolved, with one pt receiving primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis and two pts receiving G-CSF treatment. No febrile neutropenia events occurred. The efficacy-evaluable population (13 pts) included all pts who had been assessed for response at any time on the study, withdrawn from treatment/study prior to reaching their first response assessment, or were on the study long enough to reach their first scheduled response assessment (planned per protocol for D15-21). The objective response rate at data cutoff was 92%. Complete (10 pts, 77%) and partial (2 pts, 15%) metabolic response (PMR) and stable disease (1 pt, 8%) were observed. One pt with initial PMR experienced PD after C8. M + Len appears to have an acceptable safety profile in R/R FL pts with >=1 prior therapy line and encouraging preliminary anti-lymphoma activity. These data support initiation of a randomised Phase III study of M + Len versus rituximab+Len.

AB  - Background: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)polatuzumab vedotin (pola)and pinatuzumab vedotin (pina)showed clinical activity and tolerability in phase 1 trials. The aim of this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study was to compare rituximab plus pola (R-pola)or pina (R-pina)in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Method(s): In this phase 2 randomised study at 39 investigational sites in six countries, patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of a dynamic hierarchical randomisation scheme, to receive R-pola or R-pina (375 mg/m2 rituximab plus 2.4 mg/kg ADCs)every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 1 year. Treatment allocations were not masked to the investigator, patients or sponsor after the patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability, and antitumour response. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01691898, and is closed to accrual. Finding(s): 81 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 42 with follicular lymphoma were recruited between Sept 27, 2012, and Oct 10, 2013, and were assigned to treatment. 81 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41 patients with follicular lymphoma were eligible for analysis. Of the 42 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received R-pina, 25 (60%, 95% CI 43-74)achieved an objective response and 11 (26%, 95% CI 14-42)achieved a complete response. Of the 39 patients in this cohort who received R-pola, 21 (54%, 95% CI 37-70)achieved an objective response, and eight (21%, 95% CI 9-36)achieved a complete response. Of the 21 patients in the follicular lymphoma cohort who received R-pina, 13 (62%, 95% CI 38-82)achieved an objective response, and one (5%, 95% CI 0.1-24)achieved a complete response. Of the 20 patients in this cohort who received R-pola, 14 (70%, 95% CI 46-88)achieved an objective response, and nine (45%, 95% CI 23-68)achieved a complete response. In the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort, grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 33 (79%)of 42 patients receiving R-pina (most common were neutropenia [29%]and hyperglycaemia [10%]; nine [21%]grade 5 adverse events, five of which were infection-related), and in 30 (77%)of 39 patients receiving R-pola (most common were neutropenia [23%], anaemia [8%]and diarrhoea [8%]; no grade 5 adverse events). In the follicular lymphoma cohort, grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 13 (62%)of 21 patients receiving R-pina (most common were neutropenia [29%]and hyperglycaemia [14%]; no grade 5 adverse events)and in ten (50%)of 20 patients receiving R-pola (most common were neutropenia [15%]and diarrhoea [10%]; one grade 5 adverse event). Interpretation(s): R-pina and R-pola are potential treatment options in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Pola was selected by the study funder for further development in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, partly because of longer durations of response than pina, and an overall benefit-risk favouring R-pola.

AB  - Background: High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by transplantation of autologous haemopoietic stem cells is frequently done as part of first-line therapy in young patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma. We investigated whether HDT with cytotoxic agents identical to those used for conventional therapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) improved survival outcome compared with conventional chemotherapy when rituximab was added to both modalities. Method(s): We did an open-label, randomised trial comparing conventional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone) and rituximab (R-CHOEP-14) with dose-escalated sequential HDT and rituximab (R-MegaCHOEP) followed by repetitive ASCT in high-risk (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index [IPI] 2 or 3) patients aged 18-60 years with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients received radiotherapy for bulky, extranodal disease, or both. Randomisation (1:1) used the Pocock minimisation algorithm; patients were stratified by age-adjusted IPI factors, bulky disease, and centre. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. All analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00129090. Finding(s): 136 patients were randomly assigned to R-CHOEP-14 and 139 to R-MegaCHOEP. 130 patients in the R-CHOEP-14 group and 132 in the R-MegaCHOEP group were included in the intention-to-treat population. After a median of 42 months (IQR 29-59), 3-year event-free survival was 69.5% (95% CI 61.3-77.7) in the R-CHOEP-14 group and 61.4% (52.8-70.0) in the R-MegaCHOEP group (p=0.14; hazard ratio 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-2.0). All 128 evaluable patients treated with R-MegaCHOEP had grade 4 leucopenia, as did 48 (58.5%) of 82 patients with documented blood counts in the R-CHOEP-14 group. All 128 evaluable patients in the R-MegaCHOEP group had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, as did 26 (33.8%) of 77 patients in the R-CHOEP-14 group with documented blood counts. The most important non-haematological grade 3 or 4 adverse event was infection, which occurred in 96 (75.0%) of 128 patients treated with R-MegaCHOEP and in 40 (31.3%) of 128 patients treated with R-CHOEP-14. Interpretation(s): In young patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma, R-MegaCHOEP was not superior to conventional R-CHOEP therapy and was associated with significantly more toxic effects. R-CHOEP-14 with or without radiotherapy remains a treatment option for these patients, with encouraging efficacy. Funding(s): Deutsche Krebshilfe. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Follicular lymphoma can be dividedin to three main subgroups: localised, advanced stageasymptomatic and advanced stage symptomaticdisease. There is as yet no evidence that chemotherapyor immunochemotherapy prolongs the life of patientsin the first two categories; the first is still best treatedwith local radiation with no evidence of any benefitfor additional therapy and the second by observationuntil symptomatic progression, although there are anumber of studies suggesting a delay in the need forchemotherapy by the use of monoclonal antibodiesthere is no conclusive evidence of long term benefitor prolongation of survival by early intervention. Inpatients with advanced stage symptomatic disease, orthose who in clinical trials fulfil the establishedGELF or BNLI criteria for therapy, progression freesurvival (PFS) has been significantly prolonged bythe use of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab incombination with chemotherapy either CVP CHOPor Bendamustine, with Fludarabine based regimensfalling out of favour as a consequence of concernsabout long term marrow toxicity and opportunisticinfection. Although anthracycline based regimensmay yield superior results to CVP, a large scale randomised study demonstrated that the combination ofBendamustine with Rituximab produced longer progression free survival than R-CHOP and this combination has now become standard of care (SOC) inmost European centres with a PFS over 5 years.Additional benefit may be observed with the use ofRituximab maintenance therapy after induction,albeit with different induction regimens, prolongingthe median duration of first remission to over 7 years, with the best results seen in those patients with anegative PET scan after the conclusion of inductionchemotherapy It is against this background that anynon chemotherapy based therapy will need to bejudged. Long term follow up data on the use ofsingle agent Rituximab as first line therapy with 2year maintenance therapy may be associated with prolonged PFS with a small cohort of patients remainingdisease free for up to 8 years, but the majority of thesepatients had a low tumour burden and the time ofdiagnosis with no immediate clinical requirement forchemotherapy More promising are the data on thecombination of the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide in combination with Rituximab, one retrospective analysis from MDACC showing anequivalent PFS with the R2 regimen compared to multiagent chemotherapy, and a prospective phase II trialfrom the same institution showing high response rateswith this chemotherapy free regimen, but as Buskepoints out in an accompanying editorial "Rituximabplus chemotherapy combinations are uniformlyaccepted as standard treatment for follicular lymphoma, underlining that we are still dependent on achemotherapy backbone if we want to offer patientswith follicular lymphoma the most effective treatmentpossible". A similar prospective study from the SAKKgroup shows a high response to this combination butno long term PFS data are yet available There arenow limited data from small phase II trials whereRituximab is combined with the bcl2 inhibitor "venetoclax" or the PI3kinase inhibitor Idelalisib, but thereare no definitive results that would enable us to conclude that we can yet discard chemotherapy fromfirst line treatment for Follicular lymphoma We alsohave to remember that even if impressive data are published in the near future, cost, toxicity and the sideeffects of long term usage of novel agents have to beset against the considerable achievements possiblewith short course non toxic chemo-immunotherapy.

AB  - The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (in particular rituximab) in the treatment algorithm of follicular lymphoma has signiicantly improved the median survival of this disease. Nevertheless, with the exception of a few special cases, it remains an incurable disease. A number of questions remain open and we are going to discuss three of them: Is watch and wait still an option? Is R-CHOP the standard first-line treatment? What is the role of autologous and allogeneic transplantation? The attitude of watching and waiting is regularly challenged because of concerns that delaying treatment could cause irreversible organ damage, permit the general condition of the patient to reduce, allow the appearance of chemotherapy resistant clones or transformation to high-grade lymphoma. Studies and experience conirm that, due to the usually slow progression of the disease, if a strict policy of regular follow- up visits is in place, organ damage and performance status reductions are readily recognized and dealt with. Studies also show that resistance to chemotherapy is not dependent on stage and inally transformation to high-grade is independent from the timing of first-line treatment. The 4 randomised studies performed in the last 2 decades confirmed that watch and wait does not confer a worse survival compared to immediate initial treatment. The very good partial and complete response rates and response duration seen with aggressive irst-line treatment, as CHOP combined with rituximab, has prompted some cooperative groups and centers to elect this regimen as a standard irst-line. Nevertheless, many studies have shown in the past that increased response rate and duration do not translate into prolonged survival. This is still true today and the comparison of many studies with different kinds of protocols, ranging from single agent chemo- or immunotherapy to very complex and aggressive combination treatments all show in the long term (as 7 years follow- up) similar progression free survival rates. In addition, the recent demonstration that the combination of rituximab and single agent bendamustine is better tolerated and as active as R-CHOP will further question the primate of R-CHOP as irst- line treatment. Several randomised trials are still ongoing to clarify which irst-line treatment, if any, is optimal for follicular lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation proved to be a good salvage treatment for patients in irst or second relapse. According to one small randomised and a few historical studies, this strategy could prolong survival compared to standard salvage chemo- immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in irst-line, four randomised studies show no advantage for this strategy. It is probable that the secondary MDS/AML and the acute toxicities could jeopardise the minimal survival advantage. On the other hand allogeneic transplantation is probably the sole modality with curative potential in this disease. Nevertheless, it is bound to very important acute toxicity, translating in almost 50% early deaths in the fist year after transplantation. Because of this, despite of the curative potential, this modality is kept for patients with early aggressive relapse, who are young and it enough to tolerate the treatment. In conclusion the treatment algorithm for irst-line follicular lymphoma should consider prognostic factors, symptoms and patient subjective priority to choose among watch and wait, intensive treatment or a milder treatment with single agents.

AB  - Objectives: Assess the effects of rituximab on salivary gland (SG) histopathology and systemically on the Tâcell compartment in the Trial for AntiâBâCell Therapy in patients with primary SjÃ¶grenâs Syndrome (TRACTISS) cohort. Methods: 26 subjects randomised to rituximab or placebo consented for SG biopsy at baseline, weeks 16 and 48. Biopsies were fluorescently assessed for Bâcells (CD20+), Tâcells (CD3+), follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (CD21+) and plasma cells (CD138+). Digital imaging analysis and semiâquantitative grading quantified SG inflammation. RNA extracted from matched SGs underwent sequencing and gene signatureâbased analysis (xCell) to infer 64 immune cell types. Matched sera were assessed for Tâhelper cytokines and Bâlymphocyte chemoattractant (CXCL13) using LEGENDplexTM and ELISA immunoassays, respectively. Results: Two cycles of rituximab prevented new Bâcell infiltration, development of FDC networks within SG inflammatory aggregates and ectopic GC organisation at 48 weeks. Gene enrichment analysis (xCell) demonstrated a prevention of classâswitchedâ and memory Bâcell infiltration by rituximab, with no effect on Tâcells or plasma cells. The reduction of ELS organisation was confirmed by transcriptomic analysis showing a downregulation of lymphocyte recruitment and ectopic GC organisation genes, such as CXCL13, CCR7, CCL19 and LTÎ². The analysis of placebo SGs transcriptomics at week 48 showed a higher expression of ectopic GC organisation genes in females compared to male subjects, suggesting a genderâdriven difference in SG inflammation progression. Peripheral markers of salivary gland inflammation and SG GC organisation, such as CXCL13, were reduced after rituximab, together with Tâcell cytokines IFNâg, ILâ4, ILâ17F, ILâ21, known to be involved in ectopic lymphomagenesis. Conclusions: Rituximab preserves residual SG function by preventing worsening SG inflammation and ELS formation compared to placebo, by affecting FDC network development and downregulating genes involved in Bâcell migration and organisation. These results reflect the clinical improvement of unstimulated whole salivary flow observed at week 48 in rituximabâtreated patients in the TRACTISS trial.

AB  - Objectives: Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to mobilise haematopoietic stem cells. Biosimilar filgrastim is now available in Europe. No differences were observed between biosimilar filgrastim (n=40) and a retrospective cohort of patients receiving originator filgrastim for stem cell mobilisation in a previous comparison, although no safety findings were reported (Lefrere et al. Adv Ther 2011;28:304-10). We compared the efficacy and safety of a biosimilar filgrastim (Zarzio, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) with originator filgrastim (Neupogen, Amgen) in patients with haematological malignancies. Method(s): A total of 108 patients were included in this study, 59 of whom were female (49 male), with an overall median age of 51 years (range 19-69). Patients had multiple myeloma (n=46), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=26), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=28) or other diagnosis (n=8). Median time from diagnosis to mobilisation was 10 months (range 3-122). After administration of mobilising regimens (primarily high-dose etoposide, high-dose cyclophosphamide, intermediate-dose Ara C or ESHAP), patients were randomised to a standard daily 10 mug/kg dose of Zarzio (n=54) or Neupogen (n=54). Result(s): Median duration of G-CSF administration was 8 days with both Zarzio (range 4-17) and Neupogen (range 4-14). Both groups had a median of one apheresis with a median time until first apheresis of 11 days. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the median (range) number of mobilised CD34+ cells/muL in peripheral blood (Zarzio, 62.0 [2-394]; Neupogen, 47.5 [2-370]) or the number of CD34+ cells/ kg body weight (Zarzio, 9.1 [0-23]; Neupogen, 9.4 [6-48]). Five patients (9%) in each group did not mobilise sufficient CD34+ cells. The adverse event profile was comparable between the Zarzio and Neupogen groups, with similar occurrence of neutropenic fever (9 vs 11 patients) and bone pain (8 vs 6 patients). Conclusion(s): Zarzio demonstrated similar efficacy and safety as the reference filgrastim (Neupogen) in haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in patients with haematological malignancies.

AB  - Advanced stage symptomatic follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is rarely, if ever, curable with conventional chemotherapy. Patients classically experience a pattern of remission and relapse, eventually dying of their disease. Data from a number of large-scale randomised phase III trials, both as first-line therapy and in relapsed/refractory patients, comparing rituximab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone indicate that the addition of rituximab to a number of different chemotherapy regimens increases response rates and progression-free survival (PFS), without significantly increasing toxicity. Moreover, in four trials, three in first-line and one in relapsed disease, a significant overall survival benefit has been observed for rituximab combination therapy. These data indicate that patients with follicular NHL who require therapy should now receive rituximab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Additionally, a strong case remains for offering rituximab-based therapy to patients with relapsed disease who have not previously received it, and in those who have previously responded well to this agent. Rituximab maintenance therapy has also been shown to significantly prolong PFS after rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease and in newly diagnosed patients who have not received rituximab during induction, and the benefit of maintenance after immunochemotherapy in relapsed patients may yet be mirrored by ongoing studies in the first-line setting. This overview considers the most recently published clinical trials of rituximab and their potential effect on clinical practice in the treatment of follicular NHL.

AB  - Optimum treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma remains challenging because there have not been any large randomised clinical trials of this rare tumour. Drugs used in treating systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma have mostly proven ineffective because of difficulties crossing the blood-brain barrier. The recognition of the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate was a substantial therapeutic breakthrough and further advances, such as the development of polychemotherapy regimens, have built on this. Whole-brain radiotherapy can consolidate response to chemotherapy, but the associated toxic effects of chemoradiation can be unacceptable. Other effective approaches include disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the use of high-dose chemotherapy. Recently, there have been attempts to optimise multi-drug chemotherapy regimens by focusing on improving survival and reducing toxic effects. A promising area of research is the incorporation of novel targeted drugs into standard treatment frameworks. In the future, greater cooperation between research groups should hopefully lead to further therapeutic advances.

AB  - Radio-immunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) has been first approved in 2004 as a treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma (FL). In April 2008, the label has been extended to the consolidation therapy after remission induction in previously untreated patients with FL on the basis of the First-line indolent trial (FIT) phase III randomised study of Zevalin as front-line consolidation versus no further treatment. Consolidation of first remission with Zevalin (15 MBq/kg), 6 to 12 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose in advanced-stage FL is highly effective with no unexpected toxicities, prolonging PFS by 2 years and resulting in 77% PR-to-CR conversion rates regardless of type of first-line induction treatment. An assessment of the dosimetry of 90-Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in the FIT study indicated that consolidation treatment was safe in all patients, including those with a CR after induction therapy. The consolidation strategy with Zevalin, as a single agent or combined with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is currently investigated in other types of B-cell lymphomas.

AB  - We investigated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of two B-cell purging methods in patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving autologous stsem cell transplantation. Myeloid and immune recoveries between the methods were compared. Twenty-seven patients were randomised to either in vivo purging with rituximab or ex vivo purging by CD34+ cell selection. Both purging methods were efficient at eliminating B-cells in infusates. When compared with in vivo purging, ex vivo purging was associated with CD34+ cell loss and delayed median neutrophil (10 d vs. 11 d) and platelet (12.5 d vs. 17 d) count recoveries. Lymphocyte recovery was similar in both groups, but immunoglobulin recovery was delayed after in vivo purging. Late-infectious complications were few in both arms. At a median follow-up of 27 months, 2-year probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) rates were 81% for in vivo purging and 76% for ex vivo purging (P = 0.66). When compared with 53 unpurged patients, all 27 purged patients had improved 3-year probabilities of overall survival (89% vs. 70%, P = 0.014) and a trend for improved EFS (78% vs. 57%, P = 0.075). In conclusion, although both purging methods were feasible and safe, rituximab purging was superior as it did not impair CD34+ cell mobilisation and was associated with faster myeloid recovery. Further studies are needed to determine whether rituximab purging is more effective than the use of unpurged autografts.

AB  - Peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT) from unrelated donors (n = 37) were compared with bone marrow transplants (BM, bone marrow group, n = 37) in a matched pair analysis. Ten patients (2, class 1) in the alloPBSCT group and seven patients (2, class 1) in the BM group had one HLA locus mismatch donor, respectively. The following factors were matched: HLA-compatibility, diagnosis, disease stage, age and gender. The median age in the PBSC group was 37 years (19-56, excluding one 6-year-old child) and in the BM group 37 years (18-53). The BM group consisted of 12 females and 25 males, 17 females and 20 males were in the PBSC group. Twelve patients in the BM and 11 patients in the PBSC group were diagnosed with AMI,; 7/7, ALL; 15/15, CML; 2/3, MDS; 1/1, NHL. Thirty-four (14/20) of the 74 patients (45%) were considered as high risk patients. The conditioning regimen was BU/CY for standard risk patients with myeloid diseases (31 patients) and TBI/CY for ALL and NHL patients (36 patients); six patients received intensified conditioning with VP16 (2 patients), thiotepa (2 patients) or melphalan (1 patient). The GVHD prophylaxis regimen was used according to the Seattle protocol. DFS was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days, in PBSC and BM transplants, respectively. The median time to leukocyte engraftment in PBSC patients was 14 days (range 6-26 days) and in the BM group 19 days (range 9-29 days; P < 0.02). The time of platelet engraftment did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 40% (four patients died, 13%) in the PBSC group and 20)% (three patients died, 8%) in the BM group, respectively (P < 0.05, log-rank). No signs of aGVHD were found in 19% of the patients in the PBSC and 27% in the BM group. Our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT does lead to a significantly faster leukocyte engraftment. The significant increase with regard to the incidence and shorter time of onset of severe aGVHD in PBSC patients, compared to marrow transplant patients, need to be confirmed in a randomised trial.

AB  - Background. The ability of allogeneic transplants performed using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen to deliver long term disease free survival is dependent on the genesis of an immunologically mediated graft-versus tumor (GVT) effect. Post-transplant immunosuppression plays an important role in limiting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) but also modulates a GVT effect. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the most commonly utilised form of GVHD prophylaxis after a RIC allograft but its impact on transplant outcome has not been studied. Aim. We wished to examine the impact of CsA dose intensity on disease relapse and overall survival (OS) in patients transplanted using an alemtuzumab based RIC regimen. Methods. CsA exposure in the first 21 days posttransplant was measured in 132 patients and correlated with overall survival, and relapse risk. 68 patients were transplanted for a myeloid malignancy (acute myeloid leukemia (n=41), myelodysplasia (n=17)) and 74 for a lymphoid malignancy (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=51) or Hodgkin's disease (n=23)). All patients with a myeloid malignancy were transplanted using a regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan and alemtuzumab (FMA). Patients with an underlying lymphoid disease were transplanted using FMA (n=31) or a regimen consisting of BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, melphalan and alemtuzumab (BEAMA) (n=43). 39 patients had chemoresistant disease at the time of transplant. All patients received intravenous CsA at a loading dose of 5 mg/kg on day -1 followed by 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. Patients were switched to oral CsA prior to discharge. Trough CsA levels were measured thrice weekly for the first three weeks after stem cell infusion and the dose of CsA adjusted to achieve levels in the region of 200-300 mug/L during this period. Trough levels obtained during the first 21 days post-transplant were used to calculate the CsA area under the curve (AUC) for each patient. Results. 71 patients were transplanted from HLA identical siblings and 61 from volunteer unrelated donors. The median age of the whole group was 48 years (range 17-68). The incidence of acute GVHD (Grades 2-4) was 34%. The median CsA AUC in the first 21 days post-transplant was 3682 microg.hr/l (range 2162-8084). In univariate analysis the presence of chemoresistant disease at the time of transplant and a high CsA AUC were both associated with a decreased OS. In multivariate analyses chemoresistant disease (HR=2.60, 95% CI 1.44-4.65, p=0.002) and linearly increasing CsA AUC were associated with an increased hazard of death (HR=1.1, 95%CI 1.02-1.24, p=0.02). The two year OS for patients with a CsA AUC less than 3682 microg.hr/l was 77% compared to 30% for patients with CsA greater than 3682 microg.hr/l (p<0.0001). Increased CsA AUC and the presence of chemorefractory disease at the time of transplant were associated with an increased risk of relapse in univariate analysis. In multivariate analyses only increased CsA AUC was significantly associated with a higher risk of relapse (OR=4.1, 95% CI 2.50-6.81, p<0.0001). Decreased CsA AUC and the use of an unrelated donor were associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD in univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the use of an unrelated donor (HR=2.9, 9%% CI 1.36-6.36, p=0.006) and linearly decreasing CsA AUC were significantly associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD (HR=1.2, 95% CI 1.05-1.43, p=0.01). Conclusions. These data identify CsA exposure as a critical and manipulable determinant of outcome after a T depleted RIC allograft. They support a randomised trial aimed at identifying the optimal CsA dose schedule in this population of patients. It will be important to determine whether post-transplant CsA exposure plays a similar role in determining outcome after a T replete RIC allograft.

AB  - Background: Chemotherapy, radiation and autologous bone marrow transplant are conventional standard therapies in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Nowadays the introduction of monoclonal antibodies has enhanced the specificity of treatment, reducing the toxicity and presenting synergism with conventional chemotherapy. Purpose(s): To compare rituximab efficacy and safety in combination with CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone) in the treatment of NHL in our hospital, with that published in the literature. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective observational study of 116 patients diagnosed with NHL who received chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab-CHOP) between January 2005 and December 2010. The authors reviewed the medical history (100%) and the data were analysed using SPSS predictive analytics software. Were recorded: demographic data (age, sex); efficacy (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), overall response rate (ORR), progression and relapse, overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS)); toxicity (haematological and non-haematological). Result(s): 53.5% of patients were male and mean age at diagnosis was 59 years. The authors obtained an ORR of 80.2% (71.3% CR and 8.9% PR). 14.8% of patients did not respond, and 5% had an unknown response. The progression and relapse rates were 18.8% and 17.8% respectively. Projected median OS for responding patients was over 30 months and EFS after one year was 70.3%. Neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia rates were reported as 15.8%, 12.4% and 2.3% respectively. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 1.95% of patients, 72.2% during the first session. The detected rate of infection was relatively low, and 3.5% of all infections were microbiologically documented. Conclusions The results obtained were comparable to those of published studies in the literature for the treatment arm with R-CHOP in randomised patients (GELA NHL-95.5 study group, U.S. Intergroup Study, Mabthera International Trial MINT study). Neutropenia rates were higher than those found in the study of McLaughlin et al, while the other cell lines the results were similar.

AB  - Current guidelines for SARSâCoV2 vaccination in immunosuppressed populations are based on limited evidence. Additionally, guidelines for the use of SARSâCoV2 vaccines in autoimmune populations are somewhat contradictory, with the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations including advice to where possible administer booster vaccinations prior to commencing immunosuppression but to preferably vaccinate while the autoimmune disease is not active. In haematological conditions it is suggested that vaccination occur prior to B cell depletion therapies e.g. rituximab, or >6 months after its use. While these guidelines were developed for nonâlive vaccines in general, the evidence for COVIDâ19 vaccines is almost entirely based on expert opinion. Clearly, with these gaps and inconsistencies in the clinical guidelines there is equipoise for the optimal timing of a booster vaccination. One of the difficulties in this field is the wide diversity of patients receiving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. We have therefore taken a pragmatic 'realâworld' approach in our design by focusing on two broad patient groups that are more specifically stratify based on preâdefine disease conditions and specific treatments. Recent data studying COVIDâ19 vaccine responses in patients on immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune/inflammatory conditions demonstrate the greatest compromise in antiâSpike IgG occurs in those receiving combination immunosuppression particularly regimens that include methotrexate and other antimetabolites, and B cell depleting therapies. In patients with haematological malignancies the lowest vaccine responses were seen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In patients with a haematological malignancy who have undergone a bone marrow transplant, immunisation to COVIDâ19 <6 months following transplantation resulted in poor IgG response to vaccine, while those immunised >6 months postâtransplant had superior responses. In contrast, other targeted therapies including the integrin inhibitor vedoluzimab or anti ILâ17/23 therapy (in the absence of concurrent methotrexate) have relatively preserved response to the initial vaccine regimen. Given the available data, we propose to study defined populations of two major immunosuppressed patient groups: Group 1): Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) and Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease, and Group 2: Autologous and Allogeneic Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. We will compare the difference between an immediate COVIDâ19 "booster" dose and a deferred COVIDâ19 "booster". In Group 1 "Immediate" is defined as prior to the commencement of moderateâtoâsevere immunosuppression and "Deferred" is defined as 6 months post commencement of moderateâtoâsevere immunosuppression. For Group 2 BMT patients, current national guidelines recommend 3 doses of preâBMT COVIDâ19 vaccines followed by 3 doses of postâBMT COVIDâ19 vaccines initiated 6 months postâBMT. In Group 2 "Immediate" is defined as 6 months postâBMT and "Deferred" as >12 months postâBMT. The primary endâpoint will be the integrated area under the curve (AUC) of antiâSARSâCoVâ2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity over the first year of immunosuppression. At present the level of antiâSARSâCoVâ2 is the most robust correlate of protection against COVIDâ19. In both study Groups the comparator of a delayed boost at 6 months is based on the premise of maximising peak NAb responses by administering the booster after induction therapy is completed. Such a delay must be weighed against the risk of reduced immunity and breakthrough COVIDâ19 infection during this period. Such a risk will be monitored closely during the study with scheduled interim safety analyses and reviews by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Participants in Group 1 will also receive a single diphtheria/tetanus (dT) toxoid booster as a comparator vaccine with the aim of determining whether the results of the optimal timing of the COVIDâ19 booster also apply to more traditional protein vaccines. If this is found to be the case, the results of this study may have broader implications for the vaccinology field and optimal clinical guidelines. Primary Objective: to determine the antiâSARSâCoVâ2 NAb response over 12 months from a booster with a mRNA SARSâCoV2 vaccine over 12 months in a population who; Group 1: are commencing moderateâtoâsevere immunosuppression for treatment of either a haematological malignancy (excluding BMT patients) or an autoimmune/inflammatory condition and are previously fullyâimmunised (i.e. had received 3 or more doses of BNT162b2, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Novovax vaccine including combinations) or, Group 2: have recently undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy and have previously received 3 postâBMT doses of BNT162b2, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Novovax vaccine including combinations. We will determine the difference between the booster being administered as follows: Group 1: immediately prior to starting moderateâtoâsevere immunosuppression or at 6 months after therapy start, by monitoring the relative sustained immunogenicity over 1 year. Group 2: immediately at 6âmonths postâBMT or deferred until >12 months postâBMT. Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess a range of secondary immunological endâpoints including: 1. . To quantitate antibodies to tetanus toxoid integrated over the 12âmonth period postârandomisation. 2. . To assess the safety and efficacy of the two approaches (immediate or deferred vaccination) including any indication of vaccineâinduced disease flares and any breakthrough infections with SARSâCoVâ2. 3. . To analyse the response to the SARSâCoV2 vaccine including: i. Breadth of NAb against the SARSâCoVâ2 variants of concern (VOC) ii. The kinetics of neutralizing antibody over time including responses to VOC iii. Memory T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses to peptide sets representing different domains of the SARSâCoVâ2 spike protein 2. To assess these responses in populations stratified by broad disease type (i.e. haematological malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients), autoimmune/inflammatory disease or haematological malignancy postâBMT and different modes of immunosuppression e.g. chemotherapy, boneâmarrow transplant, Bâcell depleting therapies, cytokine inhibition. 3. To use a computational biology approach to a) model the level of protection over time based on neutralizing antibody levels and b) model the boosting and decay of antiâSpike IgG, specific memory B, T and NK cell response to provide information on the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine protection over time. 4. To use this evidenceâbase to inform policies regarding timing of additional SARSâCoVâ2 boosters in vulnerable populations about to commence immunosuppression/or following bone marrow transplant. These findings will identify those patient groups most appropriate for synthetic COVIDâ19 monoclonal antibodies and will contribute to our understanding of vaccinology in the setting of immunosuppression and BMT more broadly, an area that remains poorly understood. 5. To compare the change in healthârelated quality of life over time between "immediate" and "deferred" booster strategies.

AB  - Background: Follicular lymphoma is the most common form of lymphoma in Europe and the USA. In this prospective, single-arm, open-labelled, multicentre non-randomised phase II trial (FLUMIZ [FLUdarabine, MItoxantrone, Zevalin] trial) we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fludarabine and mitoxantrone plus radioimmunotherapy in untreated patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Method(s): Patients with stage III or IV untreated indolent follicular NHL were enrolled between June 1, 2004, and April 15, 2006, at 13 Italian institutions, and were treated with oral fludarabine (40 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) and intravenous mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 on day 1) every 28 days for six cycles. Patients who had at least a partial response (PR) with normal platelet counts (>100x109/L) and granulocyte counts (1.5x109/L), and bone-marrow infiltration less than 25% 4-6 weeks after completion of the sixth cycle of chemotherapy were deemed eligible for consolidation treatment 6-10 weeks after the sixth cycle with one course of yttrium-90 (90Y)-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which consisted of an initial infusion of intravenous rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 followed by a second 250 mg/m2 infusion on day 7, 8, or 9. The second infusion was followed by a weight-based dose of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, administered as a slow intravenous push over 10 min. Primary endpoints were complete response (CR) and haematological toxic effects and secondary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. Responses were classified according to the International Workshop for Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered as a European Standard Controlled Trial on the EudraCT website http://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it, number 2004-002211-92. Finding(s): 61 patients were enrolled in the trial and received six cycles of fludarabine and mitoxantrone, after which an overall response was noted in 98% (60 of 61) of patients (43 of 61 patients had CR and 17 of 61 patients had PR). 57 patients (43 with CR and 14 with PR) were deemed eligible for subsequent 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. Of the 14 patients who had PR after the initial treatment, 12 obtained CR after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. By the end of the entire treatment regimen 55 of 57 patients achieved CR. With a median follow-up of 30 months (range 21-48), 3-year progression-free survival was estimated to be 76% (95% CI 72.3-82.4) and 3-year overall survival 100%. 36 of 57 patients had grade 3 or 4 haematological toxic effects, and blood transfusions were given to 21 of 57 patients. Interpretation(s): This trial has provided evidence for the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of fludarabine and mitoxantrone plus 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in untreated patients with follicular NHL.

AB  - Questions: 1. In what groups of lymphoma patients has rituximab been studied? 2. What beneficial treatment outcomes are associated with the use of rituximab in patients with lymphoma? 3. What is the toxicity of rituximab? 4. What patients are more-or-less likely to benefit from treatment with rituximab?. Perspective(s): Evidence was selected and reviewed by 2 people, one of whom is a member of the Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiatives Haematology Disease Site Group (DSG). This evidence summary has been reviewed, discussed, and approved by the DSG, which comprises haematologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, methodologists, and community representatives. Methodology: Sources of Evidence: Relevant evidence was identified by a systematic search of the MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, PUBMED databases, and the Cochrane Library (using the text words 'rituxan,' 'rituximab,' 'ritux:,' and 'IDEC C2B8'). Also searched were the American Society of Hematology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Lugano meeting conference proceedings; the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Physician Data Query databases; and reference lists from selected articles. Patient Population: Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Outcomes of Interest: Survival, quality of life, time-to-progression, response duration, response rate, and toxicity were the primary outcomes of interest. Result(s): Search Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified: 1 randomised trial of 2 different dosing strategies for rituximab in intermediate-grade lymphoma; 11 reports of single-arm studies of rituximab in follicular, low-grade lymphoma, or mantle-cell lymphoma; 1 abstract of a published paper; 8 abstracts of single-arm studies of rituximab in low- and intermediate-grade lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders; 3 abstracts of single-arm studies of rituximab in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or interferon alpha in follicular, low- or intermediate-grade lymphoma; 1 paper of a single-arm study of rituximab in combination with CHOP in follicular or low- grade lymphoma; 1 abstract of a single-arm study of rituximab in combination with fludarabine; 1 abstract of rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide; and 1 abstract of rituximab in combination with carmustine (BCNU), cyclophosphamide and etoposide in low-grade or follicular non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Benefits: The response rates were highest in patients with follicular lymphoma (60%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 52-68%) and lowest for those with small lymphocytic lymphoma (18%; 95% CI: 8-28%). Response rates were higher for patients still sensitive to conventional chemotherapy. Data on 1-year survival for mantle-cell lymphoma patients was 80% with a median duration of response of 14.4 months. Data on quality of life were not available. Harms: Detailed toxicity data were provided in the published phase II study. The majority of patients (84%) treated with rituximab in this study had adverse events. The most common of these were: fever (43%), chills (28%), nausea (18%), headache (14%), and allergic symptoms (43%) including angio-oedema (14%). Severe (grade 3 or 4) toxicity was uncommon. Little haematologic toxicity was noted and there did not appear to be any increase in infections up to 1 year after therapy. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first infusion. A 'Dear Doctor' letter was issued indicating that following approval of the drug in the United States (November 1997) and in Europe (June 1998), there were reports of 8 fatalities resulting from cytokine-release syndrome in an estimated 12 000-14 000 treated patients. These reactions occurred early in the first infusion. This appears more common in patients with high tumour burden or who have more than 50 x 109 circulating malignant cells per litre. Future Steps: Rituximab alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, is being compared with conventional chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, as well as those with newly diagnosed, low-grade or follicular lymphoma. It is also being evaluated as part of initial therapy for intermediate-grade lymphoma. At present, the evidence does not allow a firm clinical recommendation on this topic. Please see the full report for a more detailed discussion of the evidence, an interpretive summary, and a description of the opinions of the Disease Site Group members.

AB  - MABCUTE (NCT01461928) is an ongoing multicentre, phase IIIb study evaluating subcutaneous (SC) rituximab maintenance in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Adult patients with histologically-confirmed relapsed/refractory CD20 + iNHL and >=1 line of immunotherapy +/-chemotherapy +/-radiotherapy, plus a CR/PR to induction (rituximab every 3- 4 weeks x8 cycles [IV 375 mg/m2 c1, SC 1400 mg, c2-8]) and 6-8 cycles' standard chemotherapy followed by standard maintenance (rituximab SC 1400 mg/8 weeks for 24 months), were randomised to further maintenance rituximab (SC 1400 mg/8 weeks) until PD, or observation. At January 16, 2013, the safety population comprised 216 patients with >=1 dose SC rituximab: 70 (32%) had completed induction (24 [11%] discontinued), 58 (27%) had entered standard maintenance (2 discontinued), and the remainder were mid-induction. Median age was 64.5 years (range 20-90). Most patients had follicular NHL (n = 131 [61%]) and the most common chemotherapy regimen was bendamustine (n = 137 [63%]). Administration-related reactions (ARRs) occurred in 61 (28%) patients after 1 dose of rituximab IV and 89 (41%) patients after a median (range) 5 (1-11) doses of rituximab SC. Most common AEs were neutropenia (n = 44 [20%]), nausea (n = 41 [19%]) and pyrexia (n = 35 [16%]). Grade >=3 AEs occurred in 70 patients (32%). SAEs occurred in 44 patients (20%). Grade 4 haematological events (n = 25 [12%]) were mostly neutropenia (n = 22 [10%]). One non-haematological grade 4 event (thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) resolved after 12 days. Reasons for discontinuation (n = 26): AEs (n = 8), patient/investigator request (n = 6), PD (n = 5), death (n = 2), other (n = 5). There were two deaths; neither was considered study drug-related. Rituximab SC is associated with transient and mainly mild/moderate ARRs which were expected given the change in administration route; other toxicities were of expected incidence and intensity with no new safety signals identified, as confirmed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Rituximab SC appears to be well tolerated and the study continues.

AB  - Background: IT-Y90was approved in follicular lymphoma, and some data indicates that it could be used in DLBCL. It has been reported that early TEP-TDM negativity is associated with a longer survival in DLBCL, which suggest that these patients could benefit of a less intensive protocol. Method(s): We conducted an international, open-label, phase II non-randomised study, in patients aged between 65 and 80 with age-adjusted (aa) IPI score of 0 and 1 and CD20+ DLBCL. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 3 cycles of RCHOP14 followed by, in case of complete response (CR), an injection of IT-Y90. Result(s): Thirty patients (M/F= 1) were included. Median age was 72.6 years (range 65 - 80). Patients had a stage III/IV, elevated LDH and IPI=1 in 38%, 16.6 and 57% respectively. 25 patients received the full treatment. Five obtained an uncomplete FDG-PET response and were excluded after 2 RCHOP cycles. 23 patients received the full IT-Y90 dosage (0.4mCi/Kg) and two received the attenuated dosage (0.3mCi/Kg). Mean treatment time was 54 days (median 52; min 48-max 69). The CR rate after RCHOP treatment was 85% [95% CI: 65-94]. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Grade III-IV neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in 45% and 4%, respectively. Five patients experienced at least one febrile neutropenia. After IT-Y90, mean duration time for platelets <50G/l was 2.08 weeks (median 2; min 0-max 5). Two patients required platelet transfusion. With a median follow-up of 29.5 months [95% CI: 23-39], the estimated 3-year PFS was 90% [95% CI: 80-100] and the 3-year OS was 100% [95% CI: 100-100]. Among patients treated with 90Y-IT, only 3 relapsed were recorded (at 6, 16 and 24 months). Conclusion(s): this study suggested the feasibility, and efficacy of a short regimen including one injection of IT-Y90for selected DLBCL in complete response after 3 cycles of RCHOP14. This results need to be confirmed by further studies.     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 1.3686483522548445     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Background: An innovative approach combining induction chemotherapy and subsequent consolidation with 90Yttrium-ibritumoma b-tiuxetan (90Y-IT) has been upgraded by shortening the chemotherapy duration and by insertion of rituximab, in untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: A prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, non-randomised phase II trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of a short fludarabine, mitoxantrone and rituximab (FMR) induction followed by radioimmunotherapy, in untreated, intermediate/high-risk, follicular NHL patients. Fifty-five patients were treated using a sequential treatment schedule consisting of 4 induction cycles of FMR chemo-immunotherapy, and a subsequent consolidating single administration of 90Y-IT, 8-12 weeks later. Patients were eligible for radioimmunotherapy if at least in partial response (PR) after induction, with normal platelet and granulocyte counts and a bone marrow infiltration <=25%. Primary study endpoints were response rate and hematological toxicities; secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Result(s): All patients received 4 induction cycles of FMR, with an overall response rate of 96.4% (38 complete responses, CR, and 15 PR). Fifty-one patients (38 in CR and 13 in PR) received 90Y-IT. By the end of the treatment, 49/55 patients achieved a CR. With a median follow-up of 21.3 months (95%CI 18.7-23.7), the estimated 3-year PFS was 80.6% (95%CI 53.7-92.8) and the 3-year OS 100.0%. Twenty-one patients showed grade 33 hematological toxicities. Conclusion(s): This study has established the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of a regimen composed by a short FMR induction with a 90Y-IT consolidation in untreated intermediate/high-risk follicular NHL patients.

AB  - DLBCL represent almost 30% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. More than 60% can be cured with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemoimmunotherapy. Patients not responding to R-CHOP often have a poor outcome, particularly those with disease refractory to frontline or subsequent therapies. Approximately 10-15% of patients treated with R-CHOP have primary refractory disease (incomplete response or relapse within 6 months after treatment) and additional 20-25% will relapse after an initial response, typically within the first 2 years. Patients with late relapses (>2 years after treatment) have better prognosis. Patients who are eligible to curative therapy should undergo full restaging to fully assess the status of their disease and to assess prognosis. A repeat biopsy at the time of relapse should strongly be considered to ensure that an alternate histology is not present, as an indolent lymphoma has been reported on repeat biopsy in approximately 17% of cases with late relapses. Gene expression profiling has delineated two distinct molecular subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell like (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC); 10-15% of cases are unclassifiable. Detailed analysis of molecular aberrations have led to proposals of new unique, genetically defined subtypes beyond the cell of origin. Transplant-eligible patients. Treatment with high-dose chemoimmunotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) offers the best chance of cure in patients with chemotherapy sensitive relapsed or refractory DLBCL, but due to advanced age and coexisting medical conditions only half of such patients are considered transplantation candidates. Approximately 50% of patients respond to initial salvage therapy and then undergo ASCT, with an overall cure rate of 25 to 35%. Management of transplant-ineligible patients. While some elderly fit patients may be eligible to ASCT and exhibit comparable outcomes to younger patients, the majority will have comorbidities that will prevent intensive chemo-immunotherapeutic approach. Few prospective trials have been conducted in elderly patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. The combination of R-GEMOX and R-bendamustine have been used for paliative purposes. For these cases, new approaches are warranted and new FDA approved drugs will be discussed on new drugs session. CAR-T cell therapy represents a major paradigm shift in the management of relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Three products, axicabtagene ciloleucil (axi-cel), tisagenlecleusil (tisa-cel) and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) are FDA-approved as third line treatment of DLBCL and are commercially available. In pivotal studies, axi-cel, tisa-cel and liso-cel have been associated with overall and complete response rates in the range of 52-82% and 40-54%, respectively, among patients with R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma. All three agents had characteristic toxicity profile with severe (grade > 3) CRS in 1-22% of patients, and severe (grade > 3) neurotoxicity in 12-28% of patients. Long-term outcome of ZUMA-1 trial recently published and 4 year OS is 41%, median OS is 25.8 months (17), on the other hand in Juliet trial, 5 year PFS is 31%. Novel therapies. Despite the advance of CAR-T cell therapy, novel therapies are needed. Several agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Polatuzumab-Bendamustin-Rituksimab has received approval based of randomised phase 2 trial involving transplantation ineligible patients with significant improvement rates of complete metabolic response, PFS and OS as compared with BR alone. Selinexor has also received approval for patients with R/R DLBCL who have received at least two lines of therapy, as a phase 2 study has shown modest single-agent acitivity. Tafasitamab is a humanised anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody with augmented Fc gama receptor afinity. Results from a phase 2 study of tafasitamab combined with lenalidomide showed efficacy, leading to regulatory approval for patients DLBCL ineligible to transplantation. Bispesific antibodies (bsAbs) refers to an antibody that has binding specificities for two different antigens. A variety of bsAbs are currently under development as therapy for B-cell lymphoma. These bsAbs target CD20 on B-cell and engage T-cells by CD3 in a 1:1 or 2:1 CD20:CD3 Fab format. In general, CRS and neurotoxicity are significantly less frequent than observed with CD-19 directed or blinatumomab therapies. In R/R DLBCL, ORR range from 37 to 90% with CRR from 19 to 55%. However, follow-up for these new bsAbs is short and the durability of responses remains to be established. Loncastuximab tesirine is a CD-19 directed antibody-drug conjugate. It has substantial single-agent antitumour activity and produces durable responses with an acceptible safety profile. 145 patients were enrolled with diagnosis of R/R DLBCL including high-risk characteristics for poor prognosis such as double-hit, triple-hit, transformed or primary refractory DLBCL. ORR was 48% with 24% CR rate, potencially offering a new therapeutic option for heavily pre-treated patients with R/R DLBCL.Copyright Â© 2021

AB  - Introduction In vivo T-cell depletion is increasingly integrated into RIC regimens as a strategy to reduce the risk of GVHD. However, this manoeuvre is associated with an increased incidence of mixed T cell chimerism which may increase the risk of disease relapse. DLI is commonly administered to achieve full donor T cell chimerism (FDTC) and treat relapse, however, it can be complicated by potentially severe and lifethreatening GVHD. There remain few studies looking at the toxicity or efficacy of DLI in the setting of a T cell depleted RIC allograft. Patients and Methods We studied the outcomes of 222 adult patients receiving DLI (matched sibling donor n=121 and adult unrelated donor n=101[21 antigenic HLA mismatches]) following allo-HSCT between 1999 and 2014 at three large UK centres. Indications for transplant were AML (n=75), NHL (n=28), CLL (n=23), MDS (n=21), CML (n=19), HL (n=16), other MPN (n=15), MM (n=14) and ALL (n=11). Most patients received a fludarabine based RIC regimen (n=200) and 204 received additional in vivo T cell depletion utilising either Alemtuzumab (n=200) or ATG (n= 4). Patients received between 1-6 (median 2) doses of DLI. The first dose of DLI was infused at a median of 283 days post-transplant (48-4510). 110 patients received DLI pre-emptively as treatment of MDTC (<95% CD3+ donor cells). 112 patients received DLI for relapse with 58 receiving prior additional cytotoxic therapy. The total dose of DLI varied between 0.1 and 215x106 CD3+ T cells (median total dose 1x107). The median follow up after administration of first DLI was 26 months (5-6152 days). Result(s): Toxicity: Grade II-IV and III-IV GvHD occurred in 36 (16%) and 23 (10%) of patients respectively, at a median of 44 days after DLI. 10 (5%) of patients experienced fatal GvHD. In multivariate analysis the initial dose of CD3+ cells (p=0.013) predicted the development of aGVHD. Of note, patient: donor HLA disparity did not increase the risk or severity of GVHD. Five patients (2.3%) developed graft aplasia. Efficacy: The 1 and 5 year overall survival (OS) after DLI administration was 78 and 59%, respectively. Of the 110 patients receiving DLI for treatment of MDTC, 103 had chimerism data following the last DLI available, of whom 85% achieved full donor T cell chimerism. In multivariate analysis the only factor predicting acquisition of FDTC was the dose of DLI. Timing of DLI post-transplant or absolute lymphocyte count did not determine response. The 5-yr OS of patients achieving FDTC as compared to those who did not was 81% versus 43%. Of patients achieving FDTC, 20% subsequently relapsed. 112 patients received DLI for cytogenetic/molecular (n=31) or morphological (n=81) disease relapse. 22/31 (71%) and 23/81 (28%) achieved CR in the above subgroups. In multivariate analyses the only factor that significantly influenced survival was whether CR was achieved. Patients achieving CR after DLI had a 5-yr OS of 96%, compared to 15% in patients who did not (p<0.001). Conclusion In this largest study to date, we conclude that DLI is an effective treatment option for MDTC and associated with a low risk of severe GVHD. Whilst survival in patients relapsing post-allograft is poor, DLI has the capacity to deliver long term survival in up to 70% of patients treated early. Our data provide the basis for a randomised clinical trial of DLI in MDTC and support the use of post-transplant monitoring of residual disease permitting pre-emptive delivery of DLI when it is most effective.

AB  - Antigenics is developing a therapeutic cancer vaccine based on heat-shock proteins (HSPs). The vaccine [HSPPC-96, Oncophage] is in a pivotal phase III clinical trial for renal cancer at 80 clinical sites worldwide. The trial is enrolling at least 500 patients who are randomised to receive surgical removal of the primary tumour followed by out-patient treatment with Oncophage((R)) or surgery only. This study was initiated on the basis of results from a pilot phase I/II study and preliminary results from a phase II study in patients with renal cell cancer. In October 2001, Oncophage was designated as a fast-track product by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Oncophage is in phase I/II trials in Italy for colorectal cancer (30 patients) and melanoma. The trials in Italy are being conducted at the Istituto dei Tumouri, Milan (in association with Sigma-Tau). Preliminary data from the phase II trial for melanoma was presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in Florida, USA, in October 2001. Oncophage is also in a phase I/II (42 patients) and a phase II trial (84 patients) in the US for renal cell cancer, a phase II trial in the US for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (35 patients), a phase II trial in the US for sarcoma (20-35 patients), a phase I/II trial in the US for melanoma (36 patients), and phase I/II trials in Germany for gastric (30 patients) and pancreatic cancers. A pilot phase I trial in patients with pancreatic cancer began in the US in 1997 with 5 patients enrolled. In November 2000, Antigenics announced that this trial had been expanded to a phase I/II study which would now include survival as an endpoint and would enroll 5 additional patients. The US trials are being performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The trials in Germany are being carried out at Johannes Gutenberg-University Hospital, Mainz. Oncophage is an autologous vaccine consisting of purified complexes of tumour-derived HSPs linked to tumour antigen peptides. When these HSPPC are readministered to a patient following surgery or biopsy of the tumour, the antigenic tumour peptides are expressed on the surface of potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. This stimulates a much more powerful anti-tumour immune response than that generated by expression of the same antigens by the tumour cell. Thus, Antigenics autologous HSP technology is attractive because it is highly specific for individual patients and circumvents the need for identification of specific antigens for individual cancers (i.e. it does not require definition of the antigenic epitopes on cancer cells) and it overcomes the immune tolerance associated with various tumours. Oncophage is manufactured in a 10-hour process from surgically resected autologous tumour. A minimum of 1-3g of tumour tissue is required to produce enough Oncophage for a course of treatment. The major limiting factor for producing Oncophage from a particular cancer is the ability to purify HSP from that cancer. From clinical studies to date, Antigenics has been able to produce HSP from 100, 98, 90, 71 and 30% of colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer tumours, respectively. The low success rate with pancreatic cancers is because of the high concentration of proteases in that tissue type. HSPs are a family of highly conserved proteins present in the cells of all organisms. They function as molecular chaperones, assisting the correct folding of polypeptides and aiding intracellular protein transport. In addition, HSPs associate with a broad range of peptides derived from intracellular protein degradation, including antigenic peptides produced in tumour cells. Antigenics has exclusively licensed worldwide rights to its HSP immunotherapeutic complexes from Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Fordham University in the USA. On 3 November 1998, Antigenics was issued a US patent (5,830,464) covering immunotherapy in which antigen-presenting cells are isolated and mixed with heat shock protein-antigen complexes purified from patients' tumours. The patent was issued to Fordham University, New York, US, who subsequently licensed it to Antigenics. Antigenics has an agreement with Sigma Tau, under the terms of which the latter company will fund 2 clinical trials in return for an option to market Oncophage in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Antigenics also has an agreement with Medison for marketing of Oncophage in Israel.

AB  - Background: Standard treatment for untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is rituximab plus chemotherapy. The incidence of histological transformation of follicular lymphoma has been reported only in heterogeneously treated populations and rarely with long-term follow-up. Additionally, the incidence of secondary malignancies after treatment, without high-dose therapy for follicular lymphoma, is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to assess progression-free survival, overall survival, incidence of secondary malignancies, and incidence of histological transformation in a 10-year follow-up analysis of the JCOG0203 trial. Method(s): In the phase 2-3 randomised JCOG0203 trial, previously untreated patients with stage III or IV indolent B-cell lymphoma, including grades 1-3 follicular lymphoma, from 44 hospital centres in Japan, were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a minimisation method to receive six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab [375 mg/m2], given on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m2], doxorubicin [50 mg/m2], vincristine [1.4 mg/m2, capped at 2.0 mg] given intravenously on day 3, and oral prednisone [100 mg once daily on days 3-7]) every 3 weeks (R-CHOP-21) or every 2 weeks (enabled by mandatory granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration once daily for 6 days, starting on day 8; R-CHOP-14) without rituximab maintenance. Age, bulky disease (nodal or extranodal mass >=10 cm in diameter on CT), and institution were used as adjustment factors. Investigators enrolled participants, and assignment to trial groups was done with a computer-assisted randomisation allocation sequence that took place centrally at the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center, without the intervention of investigators. Interventions were not masked for patients or investigators. Data were collected 10 years after enrolment of the last patient. The primary endpoint of the phase 3 part of the study was progression-free survival, and the primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response. Accrual was 4.5 years, and follow-up was 3 years after registration was closed. Data were updated on the cutoff date of Feb 28, 2017. Intention-to-treat analyses (ie, progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of secondary malignancies) were predefined, to be done at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. An additional analysis of the incidence of histological transformation was defined 15 years after the protocol, on May 8, 2017, in a supplementary analysis plan, and assessed at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. Follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00147121. Finding(s): Between Sept 1, 2002, and Feb 28, 2007, 300 patients were enrolled, and 149 (50%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-21 group and 151 (50%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-14 group. After eligibility was assessed, one patient was excluded from the R-CHOP-21 group. 10-year progression-free survival was not different between groups (R-CHOP-21 33%, 95% CI 25-41; R-CHOP-14 39%, 31-47; hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.67-1.17). In 248 patients with grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma, progression-free survival was 39% (33-45) at 8 years and 36% (30-42) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of histological transformation was 3.2% (95% CI 1.5-6.0) at 5 years, 8.5% (5.4-12.4) at 8 years, and 9.3% (6.1-13.4) at 10 years after enrolment. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies was 8.1% (5.1-12.0) and the cumulative incidence of haematological secondary malignancies was 2.9% (1.3-5.5). Interpretation(s): R-CHOP is a viable option for first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced follicular lymphoma. Clinicians choosing a first-line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma should be cautious of secondary malignancies caused by immunochemotherapy and severe complications of infectious diseases in the long-term follow-up-both of which could lead to death.

AB  - To compare toxicity of etoposide bolus with continuous infusion and to assess the efficacy of the CEMP (cisplatinum, etoposide, mitoxantrone, prednisone) regimen, 47 patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma older than 60 years (n = 43) or not qualifying for high-dose chemotherapy (n = 4) received five four-weekly CEMP cycles. Patients were randomised to start with bolus or continuous-infusion etoposide and then received bolus and infusional etoposide in an alternating fashion. The primary objective was the comparison of differences in the course of leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia between the two application schedules. CEMP was well tolerated with little organ and moderate haematotoxicity. There was no difference in toxicity between bolus and continuous-infusion etoposide. Complete remission rate was 44% in patients relapsing >=1 year, 27% in patients relapsing within the first year after achieving complete remission and 5% in primary refractory patients. Median event-free and overall survivals for all patients were 3 and 10 months, respectively. The observed equitoxicity and the more challenging logistics of a 60-h infusion make bolus injection the preferred application of etoposide. As the CEMP regimen is well tolerated and efficacious in elderly patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for whom more aggressive therapies are not feasible, a three-weekly modification of CEMP should be tested in combination with rituximab.

AB  - Patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia or aggressive lymphoma not only suffer from the direct side effects of chemotherapy such as infections due to long-lasting immuno-suppression and aplasia, but also from marked fatigue and the inability to do normal physical activity. Furthermore, especially in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia, doctors recommend abstaining from physical exercise due to the risk of potential bleeding and tissue damage. The normally recommended cutoff level to perform exercise is 50,000 platelets per microliter or haemoglobin of 8 g/dl. This leads to a vicious cycle of loosing physical strength and muscles with subsequent development of treatment-related cachexia and an increased treatment mortality. As number of publications focus on the importance of physical exercise in patients with solid tumours, increasing evidence is found that suggests positive effects on major clinical endpoints such as rate of infection, quality of life and even relapse rate and overall survival. With this work, we intended to address whether intense supervised ergometer training is feasible in patients with severe pancytopenia and whether it has any effect on patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study was initiated as the groundwork for a large phase III randomised trial. Â© 2009 The Japanese Society of Hematology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-transplantation (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-negativity is one of the strongest predictors of outcome after high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and activity of PET-adapted salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin, followed by augmented ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). METHODS: In this non-randomised, open-label, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who had failed one previous doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen. All patients received weekly infusions of 1Â·2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin on days 1, 8, and 15 for two 28 day cycles. After completion of brentuximab vedotin treatment, patients received a PET scan. Patients who achieved PET-negative status (a Deauville score of 1 or 2) proceeded directly to HDT/ASCT; those with persistent abnormalities on PET received two cycles of augmented ICE (augICE; two doses of ifosfamide 5000 mg/m(2) in combination with mesna 5000 mg/m(2) continuous infusion over 24 h, days 1 and 2; one dose of carboplatin AUC 5, day 3; three doses of etoposide 200 mg/m(2) every 12 h, day 1) before consideration for HDT/ASCT. Only patients with persistent abnormalities on PET after brentuximab vedotin received augICE; however, all patients in the intention-to-treat population were assessed for the primary outcome, which was the proportion of patients who were PET-negative after brentuximab vedotin alone or brentuximab vedotin followed by augICE. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01508312, and is no longer accruing patients. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2012, and Oct 4, 2013, we enrolled 46 patients. One patient was deemed ineligible, and not evaluable, before treatment initiation owing to having nodular, lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma and thus 45 patients received treatment. After brentuximab vedotin, 12 patients (27%, 95% CI 13-40) were PET-negative and proceeded to HDT/ASCT. 33 (73%, 95% CI 60-86) patients were PET-positive after brentuximab vedotin; one PET-positive patient withdrew consent, therefore 32 PET-positive patients received augICE, 22 (69%, 95% CI 53-85) of whom were PET-negative. Overall, 34 patients (76%, 95% CI 62-89) achieved PET-negativity. All 44 patients who completed treatment as per protocol proceeded to receive HDT/ASCT. Brentuximab vedotin was well tolerated and associated with few grade 3-4 adverse events including hyperglycaemia (two [4%] patients, grade 3), nausea (one [2%], grade 3), hypoglycaemia (one [2%], grade 3 and one [2%], grade 4), and hypocalcaemia (one [2%], grade 3 and one [2%], grade 4). INTERPRETATION: PET-adapted sequential salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin followed by augICE resulted in a high proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma achieving PET-negativity, and therefore could optimise the chance of cure after HDT/ASCT.

AB  - Introduction: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common subtypes of lymphoma in Western countries, accounting for 10-20% of all newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Clinical course of FL is typically indolent, with impressive responses to initial treatments. Nevertheless, frequent relapses with shorter remission duration occur that need additional therapeutic interventions and increase the risk of drug resistance. Treatment options for treatment-naive or recurring follicular lymphoma patients are still controversial, ranging from watch and wait to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. When a treatment is indicated, chemotherapy is usually prescribed. In most recent years, the advent of anti CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab (R) has dramatically changed the approach to this disease, and immunochemotherapy is at present considered the standard of care for patients diagnosed with high tumor burden FL, leading at advances in Progression Free Survival ( PFS) and Overall Survival(OS)1-3. Discussion(s): In order to prolong remission duration, the use of maintenance strategies after the first treatment has been considered over a long time. The use of interferon was first evaluated, showing benefits in terms of duration of remission and survival4; however, the safety profile of the drug and the low manageability of treatment has led most physicians to abandon this treatment option. The availability of rituximab as an effective and low toxic single agent has suggested to explore the possibility to use it not only to improve efficacy of chemotherapy in first line therapy, but also to delay progression after initial treatment reflecting the ideal maintenance strategy which involve clinical benefit, good tolerance and convenient administration. The PRIMA trial clearly showed that rituximab maintenance in patients achieving a response to initial chemoimmunotherapy results in an improved outcome in terms of prolonged PFS and made a step forward in the management of patients with FL5. However, one important question that can be raised is whether this approach is really needed for all patients with FL or if some of them could benefit from a risk adapted maintenance strategy, intensifying treatment in those recognized at high risk of recurrence, and reducing it in patients at lower risk. For example, in patients with low tumor burden who received front line rituximab, the RESORT study clearly showed that retreatment with rituximab instead rituximab maintenance was associated with an excellent outcome (86% chemotherapy free at 3 years), lack of Quality of Life difference and fewer rituximab doses required. 6 Recently, response to therapy assessed either with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) or with highly sensitive molecular techniques targeting the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (Minimal residual disease - MRD) have been suggested as important prognostic factors and are both identified as pivotal tools to achieve the goal of personalized treatment. The predictive value of PET and MRD is clearly recognized based on a large bulk of published evidence, and might be used to better tailoring post induction treatment in patients achieving satisfactory response with rituximab containing regimens. Post-induction FDG-PET provides powerful prognostic information in FL. About 80-85% of patients achieve a complete metabolic response (CMR) following immunochemotherapy and have an excellent outcome irrespective of whether rituximab maintenance is given (~95% survival at 6 years). In contrast, the ~15-20% of patients who fail to achieve a CMR are expected to have a significantly worse outcome.7, 8 Several studies indicate that, regardless to the treatment administered, the absence in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of neoplastic cells bearing the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement during the follow-up was strongly associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, clearly suggesting the need for MRD detection in FL 9-12 In the year 2012 the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) launched the prospective randomized FOLL12 trial, with the aim of verifying whether combining clinical response assessed on FDG-PET scan and molecular response measured through MRD detection could permit to single out patients at different risk of progression and to consequently modulate maintenance. In April, 2018 the planned accrual has been reached, with the accrual of 807 cases. Patients randomized to standard Arm received two years of rituximab maintenance according to the PRIMA schedule. Those in the experimental Arm and at low risk defined by post induction PET and MDR negativity, did not receive any further maintenance; however, 4 weekly doses of rituximab were allowed in case of MDR positivity during follow-up, for a maximum of three re-treatments. On the contrary, patients at high risk (post induction PET positive), received intensified maintenance with (90)Y Ibritumomab Tiuxetan followed by rituximab maintenance for 2 years. Some very preliminary analyses of the study will be presented at conference site. Conclusion(s): Despite rituximab maintenance has shown its beneficial effect in prolonging PFS, its ability in improving OS is still questionable. In this context we believe that the results of the FOLL12 study would provide a more rationale use of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic resources, thus offering the opportunity of better tailoring maintenance therapy in patients responding to first line chemoimmunotherapy.

AB  - Aims. Follicular lymphoma WHO grade I or II (FL) in early stage nodal disease can be treated effectively by radiotherapy alone. The extent of optimal target volumes remains controversial with a high rate of relapse (REL) out-field after Involved field irradiation, but higher toxicity and potentially risks of secondary neoplasia after large field techniques. Therefore, this study aimed to determine curative age-adapted irradiation volumes in younger [randomized trial (RD)] and standardized radiotherapy in elderly [prospective observation trial (OBS)] FL patients (pts). Methods. In FL stage I-II and limited stage III disease, pts<=65 years (ys) were randomized to Extended field (EF) or Total lymphatic irradiation (TLI), dose 30 Gy + boost 10 or 14 Gy. Pts aged 66-75 ys were treated with EF, all pts>75 ys with involved field (IF) radiotherapy. Results. A total of qualified 255 pts were recruited. In the RD trial, 202 pts were randomized to EF or TNI, median age 54 ys. In the OBS trial 53 pts, median age 70 ys, were treated with EF (79%) or IF (21%). At 5 ys after recruitment, overall survival of all pts is 97% at a median observation period of 77 months, relapse- (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are 60% and 60% at six years. Complete remissions (CR) were 93%, REL were 33%, median interval 27 months. In the RD pts, significant differences emerge in favor of TNI vs. EF treatment with PFS p=0.002 and RFS p=0.03. REL developed predominantly as new manifestations (92%, 77% new site alone), more often out-of than in-field. REL were entirely nodal (76%). New sites were in 75% located on the opposing side of the diaphragm. REL-histologies, revealing transition into secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 29% of biopsied pts (22% of all REL, 7% of all study pts), median 29 months from diagnosis. Secondary tumors were observed in 25 of all pts (10%) (8 EF-pts, 7 TNI-pts; 10 OBS trial-pts) and included AML/MDS (n=5), skin tumors (n=5), prostrate cancer (n=4), breast cancer (n=3), cancer of the oesophagus, the bladder, the stomach, the cervix uteri, angiosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease (<=2 cases each), at a median interval of 70 months. In the RD trial 14 pts (7%) died, 12/14 pts (86%) after progress/relapse and further diseases (8/9 in the EF, 4/5 in the TNI arm), and one each of myocardial infarction and sepsis. In the OBS trial three pts died (relapse/senile decay/MDS). Conclusions. In early stage nodal FL, standardized RT easily induced high rates of CR with excellent survival. In the randomised trial remission stability was significantly improved by TNI as opposed to EF, while the risk of secondary neoplasms was similar in both treatment arms. However, in the meantime, regional radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy has been evaluated in FL and molecular and cytogenetic factors may contribute to the identification of patients for these newer treatment approaches.

AB  - Anaemia is a common complication in the treatment of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but there are no published data on the effect of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in such patients. This is the first open-label, phase II, dose-finding study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.). Ninety-three anaemic patients with aggressive NHL who were receiving chemotherapy (including many advanced NHL, heavily pretreated patients) were randomised to receive 2.1, 4.2 or 6.3 mug/kg C.E.R.A. subcutaneously once every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Haematopoietic response was achieved in 45%, 57% and 65% of patients at the respective dose level. During weeks 5-13, the mean haemoglobin changes from baseline in the intent-to-treat population were increases of 0.2, 2.4, and 5.7 g/l in the 2.1, 4.2, and 6.3 mug/kg treatment groups, respectively, and 4.4, 5.7 and 6.8 g/l in the per-protocol population at the respective dose levels. C.E.R.A. was generally well tolerated in all three groups. C.E.R.A. appeared to have dose-dependent clinical activity in most anaemic patients with aggressive NHL who were receiving chemotherapy.

AB  - Intensive cytotoxic therapy with bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) allows a potential cure for haematological malignancies. Protective strategies to minimise haematological toxicities have been successful and currently toxicity to the gastro-intestinal tract is the major cause of treatment-related morbidity and the dose-limiting factor that prevents further dose escalation. In a randomised, placebo-controlled trial we investigated whether an oral immunoglobulin preparation (IgA-IgG) can diminish intestinal toxicity with autologous BMT. IgA-IgG (n = 6) and placebo (n = 7) were orally administered from 1 day prior to the start until 1 week after the termination of the cytotoxic treatment (a total of 14 days). Intestinal toxicity was assessed by a 51Cr-EDTA absorption test for intestinal permeability and by the clinical criteria laid down by the WHO for the period before the start of the cytotoxic treatment, 1 day prior to stem-cell infusion and 4, 7, 10 and 14 days after stem-cell infusion. In the placebo group there was a significant increase in intestinal permeability on day 4 (P < 0.005) and on day 7 (P < 0.05) after stem-cell infusion, compared with the baseline, which was not seen for IgA-IgG. In addition, patients receiving IgA-IgG had significantly less intestinal permeability on day 4 (P < 0.05) and on day 7 (P < 0.05), compared with the placebo group. No significant, positive effect as regards clinical toxicity was observed. Oral administration of IgA-IgG to patients undergoing intensive cytotoxic therapy prior to BMT seems to have a protective effect on the gut mucosa barrier which is normally disrupted by this therapy.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of patients with DLBCL who are unsuitable for anthracycline containing chemotherapy remains a clinical challenge. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue which has proven efficacy in the relapse setting in both non Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. We therefore developed a protocol incorporating Gemcitabine in a first line approach combined with CVP-R chemo-immunotherapy in DLBCL patients considered unfit for anthracycline containing chemotherapy. Method(s): We performed a prospective, multicentre phase II trial in patients with DLCBL who were considered unfit for anthracycline containing chemo-immunotherapy. Eligibility criteria included ejection fraction < 50%, or ejection fraction >= 50% but with the presence of attendant significant co-morbidities (including: ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus), and ECOG PS 0-3. Patients received 6 cycles of Rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV D1), Cyclophosphamide (750mg/m2 IV D1), Vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 IV D1), Prednisolone (100mg, orally D1-5) and Gemcitabine IV D1 and D8. The Gemcitabine dose, if tolerated was sequentially escalated from 750mg/m2 in cycle 1 to 875mg/m2 in cycle 2 to 1000mg/m2 in cycle 3 with the dose maintained at 1000mg/m2 for cycles 4-6. Cycles were repeated every 21 days with growth factor support administered on day 9 of each cycle (pegfilgrastrim 6mg s/c).The primary endpoint was to achieve an overall response rate of > 40% assessed by CT scan at the end of treatment according to the Cheson criteria. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival and overall survival. Result(s): 62 patients were recruited from 32 UK sites over a 28 month period from April 2008 to July 2010. 66% were male. Median age was 76 years (range 52-90), 48 (77%) were > 70 years. 43 (69%) had stage III/IV disease and 46 (72%) had high - intermediate or high IPI (3-5) disease. ECOG performance status was >= 2 in 50% patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was < 50% in 28 patients (45%). The 34 patients with LVEF >= 50% had significant co-morbidities, 22 (65%) had multiple co-morbidities. 44 (70%) received >= 3 cycles of treatment, reasons for early termination of treatment in the remaining 18 patients were progression (n=2), toxicity (n=5), death (n=6) patient choice (n=1) and other (n=4). 29 patients (47%) received the full 6 cycles. A total of 250 treatment cycles were delivered. Of the 44 patients who received >= 3 cycles of treatment, the dose of Gemcitabine was escalated to the full dose (1000mg/m2) in 67%. Day 8 Gemcitabine was delivered in 215/250 (86%) cycles of treatment. The overall response rate (CR/CRu/PR) at end of treatment for all 62 patients was 60%. For patients who received >= 3 cycles of treatment (n =44) the ORR was 79.5% at the end of treatment. There was no significant difference in ORR between those with LVEF <50% and those with LVEF >= 50% (71% vs 53%, p=0.155). At a median follow up of 18.2 months the 1 year progression free survival rate for all patients was 52.9% (95% CI 39.4-64.8). The 1 year overall survival (OS) rate is 62.4% (95% CI 48.5-73.6). For the group with LVEF <50% OS was 70.8% (95% CI: 48.4, 84.9) and LVEF group >= 50% OS was 55.9% (95% CI 37.1-71).Grade 3/4 haematological toxicity was observed in 54.1% patients. Grade 3/4 infection was observed in 24.6% of patients. The death rate observed related to infection for the whole cohort was 11%. Conclusion(s): This multicentre trial demonstrates that the R-GCVP regimen delivers excellent overall response rates with durable remissions in a group of patients where anthracycline use was precluded. The efficacy attained in this difficult group of patients provides a platform for testing the regimen in subsequent randomised phase II and phase III studies to confirm its efficacy.
