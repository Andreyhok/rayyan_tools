AB  - Background: Chemotherapy, radiation and autologous bone marrow transplant are conventional standard therapies in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Nowadays the introduction of monoclonal antibodies has enhanced the specificity of treatment, reducing the toxicity and presenting synergism with conventional chemotherapy. Purpose(s): To compare rituximab efficacy and safety in combination with CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone) in the treatment of NHL in our hospital, with that published in the literature. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective observational study of 116 patients diagnosed with NHL who received chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab-CHOP) between January 2005 and December 2010. The authors reviewed the medical history (100%) and the data were analysed using SPSS predictive analytics software. Were recorded: demographic data (age, sex); efficacy (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), overall response rate (ORR), progression and relapse, overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS)); toxicity (haematological and non-haematological). Result(s): 53.5% of patients were male and mean age at diagnosis was 59 years. The authors obtained an ORR of 80.2% (71.3% CR and 8.9% PR). 14.8% of patients did not respond, and 5% had an unknown response. The progression and relapse rates were 18.8% and 17.8% respectively. Projected median OS for responding patients was over 30 months and EFS after one year was 70.3%. Neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia rates were reported as 15.8%, 12.4% and 2.3% respectively. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 1.95% of patients, 72.2% during the first session. The detected rate of infection was relatively low, and 3.5% of all infections were microbiologically documented. Conclusions The results obtained were comparable to those of published studies in the literature for the treatment arm with R-CHOP in randomised patients (GELA NHL-95.5 study group, U.S. Intergroup Study, Mabthera International Trial MINT study). Neutropenia rates were higher than those found in the study of McLaughlin et al, while the other cell lines the results were similar.

AB  - Current guidelines for SARS‐CoV2 vaccination in immunosuppressed populations are based on limited evidence. Additionally, guidelines for the use of SARS‐CoV2 vaccines in autoimmune populations are somewhat contradictory, with the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations including advice to where possible administer booster vaccinations prior to commencing immunosuppression but to preferably vaccinate while the autoimmune disease is not active. In haematological conditions it is suggested that vaccination occur prior to B cell depletion therapies e.g. rituximab, or >6 months after its use. While these guidelines were developed for non‐live vaccines in general, the evidence for COVID‐19 vaccines is almost entirely based on expert opinion. Clearly, with these gaps and inconsistencies in the clinical guidelines there is equipoise for the optimal timing of a booster vaccination. One of the difficulties in this field is the wide diversity of patients receiving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. We have therefore taken a pragmatic 'real‐world' approach in our design by focusing on two broad patient groups that are more specifically stratify based on pre‐define disease conditions and specific treatments. Recent data studying COVID‐19 vaccine responses in patients on immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune/inflammatory conditions demonstrate the greatest compromise in anti‐Spike IgG occurs in those receiving combination immunosuppression particularly regimens that include methotrexate and other antimetabolites, and B cell depleting therapies. In patients with haematological malignancies the lowest vaccine responses were seen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In patients with a haematological malignancy who have undergone a bone marrow transplant, immunisation to COVID‐19 <6 months following transplantation resulted in poor IgG response to vaccine, while those immunised >6 months post‐transplant had superior responses. In contrast, other targeted therapies including the integrin inhibitor vedoluzimab or anti IL‐17/23 therapy (in the absence of concurrent methotrexate) have relatively preserved response to the initial vaccine regimen. Given the available data, we propose to study defined populations of two major immunosuppressed patient groups: Group 1): Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) and Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease, and Group 2: Autologous and Allogeneic Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. We will compare the difference between an immediate COVID‐19 "booster" dose and a deferred COVID‐19 "booster". In Group 1 "Immediate" is defined as prior to the commencement of moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression and "Deferred" is defined as 6 months post commencement of moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression. For Group 2 BMT patients, current national guidelines recommend 3 doses of pre‐BMT COVID‐19 vaccines followed by 3 doses of post‐BMT COVID‐19 vaccines initiated 6 months post‐BMT. In Group 2 "Immediate" is defined as 6 months post‐BMT and "Deferred" as >12 months post‐BMT. The primary end‐point will be the integrated area under the curve (AUC) of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity over the first year of immunosuppression. At present the level of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 is the most robust correlate of protection against COVID‐19. In both study Groups the comparator of a delayed boost at 6 months is based on the premise of maximising peak NAb responses by administering the booster after induction therapy is completed. Such a delay must be weighed against the risk of reduced immunity and breakthrough COVID‐19 infection during this period. Such a risk will be monitored closely during the study with scheduled interim safety analyses and reviews by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Participants in Group 1 will also receive a single diphtheria/tetanus (dT) toxoid booster as a comparator vaccine with the aim of determining whether the results of the optimal timing of the COVID‐19 booster also apply to more traditional protein vaccines. If this is found to be the case, the results of this study may have broader implications for the vaccinology field and optimal clinical guidelines. Primary Objective: to determine the anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 NAb response over 12 months from a booster with a mRNA SARS‐CoV2 vaccine over 12 months in a population who; Group 1: are commencing moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression for treatment of either a haematological malignancy (excluding BMT patients) or an autoimmune/inflammatory condition and are previously fully‐immunised (i.e. had received 3 or more doses of BNT162b2, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Novovax vaccine including combinations) or, Group 2: have recently undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy and have previously received 3 post‐BMT doses of BNT162b2, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Novovax vaccine including combinations. We will determine the difference between the booster being administered as follows: Group 1: immediately prior to starting moderate‐to‐severe immunosuppression or at 6 months after therapy start, by monitoring the relative sustained immunogenicity over 1 year. Group 2: immediately at 6‐months post‐BMT or deferred until >12 months post‐BMT. Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess a range of secondary immunological end‐points including: 1. . To quantitate antibodies to tetanus toxoid integrated over the 12‐month period post‐randomisation. 2. . To assess the safety and efficacy of the two approaches (immediate or deferred vaccination) including any indication of vaccine‐induced disease flares and any breakthrough infections with SARS‐CoV‐2. 3. . To analyse the response to the SARS‐CoV2 vaccine including: i. Breadth of NAb against the SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern (VOC) ii. The kinetics of neutralizing antibody over time including responses to VOC iii. Memory T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses to peptide sets representing different domains of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein 2. To assess these responses in populations stratified by broad disease type (i.e. haematological malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients), autoimmune/inflammatory disease or haematological malignancy post‐BMT and different modes of immunosuppression e.g. chemotherapy, bone‐marrow transplant, B‐cell depleting therapies, cytokine inhibition. 3. To use a computational biology approach to a) model the level of protection over time based on neutralizing antibody levels and b) model the boosting and decay of anti‐Spike IgG, specific memory B, T and NK cell response to provide information on the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine protection over time. 4. To use this evidence‐base to inform policies regarding timing of additional SARS‐CoV‐2 boosters in vulnerable populations about to commence immunosuppression/or following bone marrow transplant. These findings will identify those patient groups most appropriate for synthetic COVID‐19 monoclonal antibodies and will contribute to our understanding of vaccinology in the setting of immunosuppression and BMT more broadly, an area that remains poorly understood. 5. To compare the change in health‐related quality of life over time between "immediate" and "deferred" booster strategies.

AB  - Background: Follicular lymphoma is the most common form of lymphoma in Europe and the USA. In this prospective, single-arm, open-labelled, multicentre non-randomised phase II trial (FLUMIZ [FLUdarabine, MItoxantrone, Zevalin] trial) we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fludarabine and mitoxantrone plus radioimmunotherapy in untreated patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Method(s): Patients with stage III or IV untreated indolent follicular NHL were enrolled between June 1, 2004, and April 15, 2006, at 13 Italian institutions, and were treated with oral fludarabine (40 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) and intravenous mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 on day 1) every 28 days for six cycles. Patients who had at least a partial response (PR) with normal platelet counts (>100x109/L) and granulocyte counts (1.5x109/L), and bone-marrow infiltration less than 25% 4-6 weeks after completion of the sixth cycle of chemotherapy were deemed eligible for consolidation treatment 6-10 weeks after the sixth cycle with one course of yttrium-90 (90Y)-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which consisted of an initial infusion of intravenous rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 followed by a second 250 mg/m2 infusion on day 7, 8, or 9. The second infusion was followed by a weight-based dose of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, administered as a slow intravenous push over 10 min. Primary endpoints were complete response (CR) and haematological toxic effects and secondary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. Responses were classified according to the International Workshop for Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered as a European Standard Controlled Trial on the EudraCT website http://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it, number 2004-002211-92. Finding(s): 61 patients were enrolled in the trial and received six cycles of fludarabine and mitoxantrone, after which an overall response was noted in 98% (60 of 61) of patients (43 of 61 patients had CR and 17 of 61 patients had PR). 57 patients (43 with CR and 14 with PR) were deemed eligible for subsequent 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. Of the 14 patients who had PR after the initial treatment, 12 obtained CR after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. By the end of the entire treatment regimen 55 of 57 patients achieved CR. With a median follow-up of 30 months (range 21-48), 3-year progression-free survival was estimated to be 76% (95% CI 72.3-82.4) and 3-year overall survival 100%. 36 of 57 patients had grade 3 or 4 haematological toxic effects, and blood transfusions were given to 21 of 57 patients. Interpretation(s): This trial has provided evidence for the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of fludarabine and mitoxantrone plus 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in untreated patients with follicular NHL.

AB  - Questions: 1. In what groups of lymphoma patients has rituximab been studied? 2. What beneficial treatment outcomes are associated with the use of rituximab in patients with lymphoma? 3. What is the toxicity of rituximab? 4. What patients are more-or-less likely to benefit from treatment with rituximab?. Perspective(s): Evidence was selected and reviewed by 2 people, one of whom is a member of the Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiatives Haematology Disease Site Group (DSG). This evidence summary has been reviewed, discussed, and approved by the DSG, which comprises haematologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, methodologists, and community representatives. Methodology: Sources of Evidence: Relevant evidence was identified by a systematic search of the MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, PUBMED databases, and the Cochrane Library (using the text words 'rituxan,' 'rituximab,' 'ritux:,' and 'IDEC C2B8'). Also searched were the American Society of Hematology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Lugano meeting conference proceedings; the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Physician Data Query databases; and reference lists from selected articles. Patient Population: Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Outcomes of Interest: Survival, quality of life, time-to-progression, response duration, response rate, and toxicity were the primary outcomes of interest. Result(s): Search Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified: 1 randomised trial of 2 different dosing strategies for rituximab in intermediate-grade lymphoma; 11 reports of single-arm studies of rituximab in follicular, low-grade lymphoma, or mantle-cell lymphoma; 1 abstract of a published paper; 8 abstracts of single-arm studies of rituximab in low- and intermediate-grade lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders; 3 abstracts of single-arm studies of rituximab in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or interferon alpha in follicular, low- or intermediate-grade lymphoma; 1 paper of a single-arm study of rituximab in combination with CHOP in follicular or low- grade lymphoma; 1 abstract of a single-arm study of rituximab in combination with fludarabine; 1 abstract of rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide; and 1 abstract of rituximab in combination with carmustine (BCNU), cyclophosphamide and etoposide in low-grade or follicular non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Benefits: The response rates were highest in patients with follicular lymphoma (60%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 52-68%) and lowest for those with small lymphocytic lymphoma (18%; 95% CI: 8-28%). Response rates were higher for patients still sensitive to conventional chemotherapy. Data on 1-year survival for mantle-cell lymphoma patients was 80% with a median duration of response of 14.4 months. Data on quality of life were not available. Harms: Detailed toxicity data were provided in the published phase II study. The majority of patients (84%) treated with rituximab in this study had adverse events. The most common of these were: fever (43%), chills (28%), nausea (18%), headache (14%), and allergic symptoms (43%) including angio-oedema (14%). Severe (grade 3 or 4) toxicity was uncommon. Little haematologic toxicity was noted and there did not appear to be any increase in infections up to 1 year after therapy. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first infusion. A 'Dear Doctor' letter was issued indicating that following approval of the drug in the United States (November 1997) and in Europe (June 1998), there were reports of 8 fatalities resulting from cytokine-release syndrome in an estimated 12 000-14 000 treated patients. These reactions occurred early in the first infusion. This appears more common in patients with high tumour burden or who have more than 50 x 109 circulating malignant cells per litre. Future Steps: Rituximab alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, is being compared with conventional chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, as well as those with newly diagnosed, low-grade or follicular lymphoma. It is also being evaluated as part of initial therapy for intermediate-grade lymphoma. At present, the evidence does not allow a firm clinical recommendation on this topic. Please see the full report for a more detailed discussion of the evidence, an interpretive summary, and a description of the opinions of the Disease Site Group members.

AB  - MABCUTE (NCT01461928) is an ongoing multicentre, phase IIIb study evaluating subcutaneous (SC) rituximab maintenance in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Adult patients with histologically-confirmed relapsed/refractory CD20 + iNHL and >=1 line of immunotherapy +/-chemotherapy +/-radiotherapy, plus a CR/PR to induction (rituximab every 3- 4 weeks x8 cycles [IV 375 mg/m2 c1, SC 1400 mg, c2-8]) and 6-8 cycles' standard chemotherapy followed by standard maintenance (rituximab SC 1400 mg/8 weeks for 24 months), were randomised to further maintenance rituximab (SC 1400 mg/8 weeks) until PD, or observation. At January 16, 2013, the safety population comprised 216 patients with >=1 dose SC rituximab: 70 (32%) had completed induction (24 [11%] discontinued), 58 (27%) had entered standard maintenance (2 discontinued), and the remainder were mid-induction. Median age was 64.5 years (range 20-90). Most patients had follicular NHL (n = 131 [61%]) and the most common chemotherapy regimen was bendamustine (n = 137 [63%]). Administration-related reactions (ARRs) occurred in 61 (28%) patients after 1 dose of rituximab IV and 89 (41%) patients after a median (range) 5 (1-11) doses of rituximab SC. Most common AEs were neutropenia (n = 44 [20%]), nausea (n = 41 [19%]) and pyrexia (n = 35 [16%]). Grade >=3 AEs occurred in 70 patients (32%). SAEs occurred in 44 patients (20%). Grade 4 haematological events (n = 25 [12%]) were mostly neutropenia (n = 22 [10%]). One non-haematological grade 4 event (thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) resolved after 12 days. Reasons for discontinuation (n = 26): AEs (n = 8), patient/investigator request (n = 6), PD (n = 5), death (n = 2), other (n = 5). There were two deaths; neither was considered study drug-related. Rituximab SC is associated with transient and mainly mild/moderate ARRs which were expected given the change in administration route; other toxicities were of expected incidence and intensity with no new safety signals identified, as confirmed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Rituximab SC appears to be well tolerated and the study continues.

AB  - Background: IT-Y90was approved in follicular lymphoma, and some data indicates that it could be used in DLBCL. It has been reported that early TEP-TDM negativity is associated with a longer survival in DLBCL, which suggest that these patients could benefit of a less intensive protocol. Method(s): We conducted an international, open-label, phase II non-randomised study, in patients aged between 65 and 80 with age-adjusted (aa) IPI score of 0 and 1 and CD20+ DLBCL. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 3 cycles of RCHOP14 followed by, in case of complete response (CR), an injection of IT-Y90. Result(s): Thirty patients (M/F= 1) were included. Median age was 72.6 years (range 65 - 80). Patients had a stage III/IV, elevated LDH and IPI=1 in 38%, 16.6 and 57% respectively. 25 patients received the full treatment. Five obtained an uncomplete FDG-PET response and were excluded after 2 RCHOP cycles. 23 patients received the full IT-Y90 dosage (0.4mCi/Kg) and two received the attenuated dosage (0.3mCi/Kg). Mean treatment time was 54 days (median 52; min 48-max 69). The CR rate after RCHOP treatment was 85% [95% CI: 65-94]. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Grade III-IV neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in 45% and 4%, respectively. Five patients experienced at least one febrile neutropenia. After IT-Y90, mean duration time for platelets <50G/l was 2.08 weeks (median 2; min 0-max 5). Two patients required platelet transfusion. With a median follow-up of 29.5 months [95% CI: 23-39], the estimated 3-year PFS was 90% [95% CI: 80-100] and the 3-year OS was 100% [95% CI: 100-100]. Among patients treated with 90Y-IT, only 3 relapsed were recorded (at 6, 16 and 24 months). Conclusion(s): this study suggested the feasibility, and efficacy of a short regimen including one injection of IT-Y90for selected DLBCL in complete response after 3 cycles of RCHOP14. This results need to be confirmed by further studies.     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 1.3686483522548445     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Background: An innovative approach combining induction chemotherapy and subsequent consolidation with 90Yttrium-ibritumoma b-tiuxetan (90Y-IT) has been upgraded by shortening the chemotherapy duration and by insertion of rituximab, in untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: A prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, non-randomised phase II trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of a short fludarabine, mitoxantrone and rituximab (FMR) induction followed by radioimmunotherapy, in untreated, intermediate/high-risk, follicular NHL patients. Fifty-five patients were treated using a sequential treatment schedule consisting of 4 induction cycles of FMR chemo-immunotherapy, and a subsequent consolidating single administration of 90Y-IT, 8-12 weeks later. Patients were eligible for radioimmunotherapy if at least in partial response (PR) after induction, with normal platelet and granulocyte counts and a bone marrow infiltration <=25%. Primary study endpoints were response rate and hematological toxicities; secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Result(s): All patients received 4 induction cycles of FMR, with an overall response rate of 96.4% (38 complete responses, CR, and 15 PR). Fifty-one patients (38 in CR and 13 in PR) received 90Y-IT. By the end of the treatment, 49/55 patients achieved a CR. With a median follow-up of 21.3 months (95%CI 18.7-23.7), the estimated 3-year PFS was 80.6% (95%CI 53.7-92.8) and the 3-year OS 100.0%. Twenty-one patients showed grade 33 hematological toxicities. Conclusion(s): This study has established the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of a regimen composed by a short FMR induction with a 90Y-IT consolidation in untreated intermediate/high-risk follicular NHL patients.

AB  - DLBCL represent almost 30% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. More than 60% can be cured with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemoimmunotherapy. Patients not responding to R-CHOP often have a poor outcome, particularly those with disease refractory to frontline or subsequent therapies. Approximately 10-15% of patients treated with R-CHOP have primary refractory disease (incomplete response or relapse within 6 months after treatment) and additional 20-25% will relapse after an initial response, typically within the first 2 years. Patients with late relapses (>2 years after treatment) have better prognosis. Patients who are eligible to curative therapy should undergo full restaging to fully assess the status of their disease and to assess prognosis. A repeat biopsy at the time of relapse should strongly be considered to ensure that an alternate histology is not present, as an indolent lymphoma has been reported on repeat biopsy in approximately 17% of cases with late relapses. Gene expression profiling has delineated two distinct molecular subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell like (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC); 10-15% of cases are unclassifiable. Detailed analysis of molecular aberrations have led to proposals of new unique, genetically defined subtypes beyond the cell of origin. Transplant-eligible patients. Treatment with high-dose chemoimmunotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) offers the best chance of cure in patients with chemotherapy sensitive relapsed or refractory DLBCL, but due to advanced age and coexisting medical conditions only half of such patients are considered transplantation candidates. Approximately 50% of patients respond to initial salvage therapy and then undergo ASCT, with an overall cure rate of 25 to 35%. Management of transplant-ineligible patients. While some elderly fit patients may be eligible to ASCT and exhibit comparable outcomes to younger patients, the majority will have comorbidities that will prevent intensive chemo-immunotherapeutic approach. Few prospective trials have been conducted in elderly patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. The combination of R-GEMOX and R-bendamustine have been used for paliative purposes. For these cases, new approaches are warranted and new FDA approved drugs will be discussed on new drugs session. CAR-T cell therapy represents a major paradigm shift in the management of relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Three products, axicabtagene ciloleucil (axi-cel), tisagenlecleusil (tisa-cel) and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) are FDA-approved as third line treatment of DLBCL and are commercially available. In pivotal studies, axi-cel, tisa-cel and liso-cel have been associated with overall and complete response rates in the range of 52-82% and 40-54%, respectively, among patients with R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma. All three agents had characteristic toxicity profile with severe (grade > 3) CRS in 1-22% of patients, and severe (grade > 3) neurotoxicity in 12-28% of patients. Long-term outcome of ZUMA-1 trial recently published and 4 year OS is 41%, median OS is 25.8 months (17), on the other hand in Juliet trial, 5 year PFS is 31%. Novel therapies. Despite the advance of CAR-T cell therapy, novel therapies are needed. Several agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Polatuzumab-Bendamustin-Rituksimab has received approval based of randomised phase 2 trial involving transplantation ineligible patients with significant improvement rates of complete metabolic response, PFS and OS as compared with BR alone. Selinexor has also received approval for patients with R/R DLBCL who have received at least two lines of therapy, as a phase 2 study has shown modest single-agent acitivity. Tafasitamab is a humanised anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody with augmented Fc gama receptor afinity. Results from a phase 2 study of tafasitamab combined with lenalidomide showed efficacy, leading to regulatory approval for patients DLBCL ineligible to transplantation. Bispesific antibodies (bsAbs) refers to an antibody that has binding specificities for two different antigens. A variety of bsAbs are currently under development as therapy for B-cell lymphoma. These bsAbs target CD20 on B-cell and engage T-cells by CD3 in a 1:1 or 2:1 CD20:CD3 Fab format. In general, CRS and neurotoxicity are significantly less frequent than observed with CD-19 directed or blinatumomab therapies. In R/R DLBCL, ORR range from 37 to 90% with CRR from 19 to 55%. However, follow-up for these new bsAbs is short and the durability of responses remains to be established. Loncastuximab tesirine is a CD-19 directed antibody-drug conjugate. It has substantial single-agent antitumour activity and produces durable responses with an acceptible safety profile. 145 patients were enrolled with diagnosis of R/R DLBCL including high-risk characteristics for poor prognosis such as double-hit, triple-hit, transformed or primary refractory DLBCL. ORR was 48% with 24% CR rate, potencially offering a new therapeutic option for heavily pre-treated patients with R/R DLBCL.Copyright © 2021

AB  - Introduction In vivo T-cell depletion is increasingly integrated into RIC regimens as a strategy to reduce the risk of GVHD. However, this manoeuvre is associated with an increased incidence of mixed T cell chimerism which may increase the risk of disease relapse. DLI is commonly administered to achieve full donor T cell chimerism (FDTC) and treat relapse, however, it can be complicated by potentially severe and lifethreatening GVHD. There remain few studies looking at the toxicity or efficacy of DLI in the setting of a T cell depleted RIC allograft. Patients and Methods We studied the outcomes of 222 adult patients receiving DLI (matched sibling donor n=121 and adult unrelated donor n=101[21 antigenic HLA mismatches]) following allo-HSCT between 1999 and 2014 at three large UK centres. Indications for transplant were AML (n=75), NHL (n=28), CLL (n=23), MDS (n=21), CML (n=19), HL (n=16), other MPN (n=15), MM (n=14) and ALL (n=11). Most patients received a fludarabine based RIC regimen (n=200) and 204 received additional in vivo T cell depletion utilising either Alemtuzumab (n=200) or ATG (n= 4). Patients received between 1-6 (median 2) doses of DLI. The first dose of DLI was infused at a median of 283 days post-transplant (48-4510). 110 patients received DLI pre-emptively as treatment of MDTC (<95% CD3+ donor cells). 112 patients received DLI for relapse with 58 receiving prior additional cytotoxic therapy. The total dose of DLI varied between 0.1 and 215x106 CD3+ T cells (median total dose 1x107). The median follow up after administration of first DLI was 26 months (5-6152 days). Result(s): Toxicity: Grade II-IV and III-IV GvHD occurred in 36 (16%) and 23 (10%) of patients respectively, at a median of 44 days after DLI. 10 (5%) of patients experienced fatal GvHD. In multivariate analysis the initial dose of CD3+ cells (p=0.013) predicted the development of aGVHD. Of note, patient: donor HLA disparity did not increase the risk or severity of GVHD. Five patients (2.3%) developed graft aplasia. Efficacy: The 1 and 5 year overall survival (OS) after DLI administration was 78 and 59%, respectively. Of the 110 patients receiving DLI for treatment of MDTC, 103 had chimerism data following the last DLI available, of whom 85% achieved full donor T cell chimerism. In multivariate analysis the only factor predicting acquisition of FDTC was the dose of DLI. Timing of DLI post-transplant or absolute lymphocyte count did not determine response. The 5-yr OS of patients achieving FDTC as compared to those who did not was 81% versus 43%. Of patients achieving FDTC, 20% subsequently relapsed. 112 patients received DLI for cytogenetic/molecular (n=31) or morphological (n=81) disease relapse. 22/31 (71%) and 23/81 (28%) achieved CR in the above subgroups. In multivariate analyses the only factor that significantly influenced survival was whether CR was achieved. Patients achieving CR after DLI had a 5-yr OS of 96%, compared to 15% in patients who did not (p<0.001). Conclusion In this largest study to date, we conclude that DLI is an effective treatment option for MDTC and associated with a low risk of severe GVHD. Whilst survival in patients relapsing post-allograft is poor, DLI has the capacity to deliver long term survival in up to 70% of patients treated early. Our data provide the basis for a randomised clinical trial of DLI in MDTC and support the use of post-transplant monitoring of residual disease permitting pre-emptive delivery of DLI when it is most effective.

AB  - Antigenics is developing a therapeutic cancer vaccine based on heat-shock proteins (HSPs). The vaccine [HSPPC-96, Oncophage] is in a pivotal phase III clinical trial for renal cancer at 80 clinical sites worldwide. The trial is enrolling at least 500 patients who are randomised to receive surgical removal of the primary tumour followed by out-patient treatment with Oncophage((R)) or surgery only. This study was initiated on the basis of results from a pilot phase I/II study and preliminary results from a phase II study in patients with renal cell cancer. In October 2001, Oncophage was designated as a fast-track product by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Oncophage is in phase I/II trials in Italy for colorectal cancer (30 patients) and melanoma. The trials in Italy are being conducted at the Istituto dei Tumouri, Milan (in association with Sigma-Tau). Preliminary data from the phase II trial for melanoma was presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in Florida, USA, in October 2001. Oncophage is also in a phase I/II (42 patients) and a phase II trial (84 patients) in the US for renal cell cancer, a phase II trial in the US for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (35 patients), a phase II trial in the US for sarcoma (20-35 patients), a phase I/II trial in the US for melanoma (36 patients), and phase I/II trials in Germany for gastric (30 patients) and pancreatic cancers. A pilot phase I trial in patients with pancreatic cancer began in the US in 1997 with 5 patients enrolled. In November 2000, Antigenics announced that this trial had been expanded to a phase I/II study which would now include survival as an endpoint and would enroll 5 additional patients. The US trials are being performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The trials in Germany are being carried out at Johannes Gutenberg-University Hospital, Mainz. Oncophage is an autologous vaccine consisting of purified complexes of tumour-derived HSPs linked to tumour antigen peptides. When these HSPPC are readministered to a patient following surgery or biopsy of the tumour, the antigenic tumour peptides are expressed on the surface of potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. This stimulates a much more powerful anti-tumour immune response than that generated by expression of the same antigens by the tumour cell. Thus, Antigenics autologous HSP technology is attractive because it is highly specific for individual patients and circumvents the need for identification of specific antigens for individual cancers (i.e. it does not require definition of the antigenic epitopes on cancer cells) and it overcomes the immune tolerance associated with various tumours. Oncophage is manufactured in a 10-hour process from surgically resected autologous tumour. A minimum of 1-3g of tumour tissue is required to produce enough Oncophage for a course of treatment. The major limiting factor for producing Oncophage from a particular cancer is the ability to purify HSP from that cancer. From clinical studies to date, Antigenics has been able to produce HSP from 100, 98, 90, 71 and 30% of colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer tumours, respectively. The low success rate with pancreatic cancers is because of the high concentration of proteases in that tissue type. HSPs are a family of highly conserved proteins present in the cells of all organisms. They function as molecular chaperones, assisting the correct folding of polypeptides and aiding intracellular protein transport. In addition, HSPs associate with a broad range of peptides derived from intracellular protein degradation, including antigenic peptides produced in tumour cells. Antigenics has exclusively licensed worldwide rights to its HSP immunotherapeutic complexes from Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Fordham University in the USA. On 3 November 1998, Antigenics was issued a US patent (5,830,464) covering immunotherapy in which antigen-presenting cells are isolated and mixed with heat shock protein-antigen complexes purified from patients' tumours. The patent was issued to Fordham University, New York, US, who subsequently licensed it to Antigenics. Antigenics has an agreement with Sigma Tau, under the terms of which the latter company will fund 2 clinical trials in return for an option to market Oncophage in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Antigenics also has an agreement with Medison for marketing of Oncophage in Israel.

AB  - Background: Standard treatment for untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is rituximab plus chemotherapy. The incidence of histological transformation of follicular lymphoma has been reported only in heterogeneously treated populations and rarely with long-term follow-up. Additionally, the incidence of secondary malignancies after treatment, without high-dose therapy for follicular lymphoma, is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to assess progression-free survival, overall survival, incidence of secondary malignancies, and incidence of histological transformation in a 10-year follow-up analysis of the JCOG0203 trial. Method(s): In the phase 2-3 randomised JCOG0203 trial, previously untreated patients with stage III or IV indolent B-cell lymphoma, including grades 1-3 follicular lymphoma, from 44 hospital centres in Japan, were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a minimisation method to receive six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab [375 mg/m2], given on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m2], doxorubicin [50 mg/m2], vincristine [1.4 mg/m2, capped at 2.0 mg] given intravenously on day 3, and oral prednisone [100 mg once daily on days 3-7]) every 3 weeks (R-CHOP-21) or every 2 weeks (enabled by mandatory granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration once daily for 6 days, starting on day 8; R-CHOP-14) without rituximab maintenance. Age, bulky disease (nodal or extranodal mass >=10 cm in diameter on CT), and institution were used as adjustment factors. Investigators enrolled participants, and assignment to trial groups was done with a computer-assisted randomisation allocation sequence that took place centrally at the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center, without the intervention of investigators. Interventions were not masked for patients or investigators. Data were collected 10 years after enrolment of the last patient. The primary endpoint of the phase 3 part of the study was progression-free survival, and the primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response. Accrual was 4.5 years, and follow-up was 3 years after registration was closed. Data were updated on the cutoff date of Feb 28, 2017. Intention-to-treat analyses (ie, progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of secondary malignancies) were predefined, to be done at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. An additional analysis of the incidence of histological transformation was defined 15 years after the protocol, on May 8, 2017, in a supplementary analysis plan, and assessed at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. Follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00147121. Finding(s): Between Sept 1, 2002, and Feb 28, 2007, 300 patients were enrolled, and 149 (50%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-21 group and 151 (50%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-14 group. After eligibility was assessed, one patient was excluded from the R-CHOP-21 group. 10-year progression-free survival was not different between groups (R-CHOP-21 33%, 95% CI 25-41; R-CHOP-14 39%, 31-47; hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.67-1.17). In 248 patients with grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma, progression-free survival was 39% (33-45) at 8 years and 36% (30-42) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of histological transformation was 3.2% (95% CI 1.5-6.0) at 5 years, 8.5% (5.4-12.4) at 8 years, and 9.3% (6.1-13.4) at 10 years after enrolment. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies was 8.1% (5.1-12.0) and the cumulative incidence of haematological secondary malignancies was 2.9% (1.3-5.5). Interpretation(s): R-CHOP is a viable option for first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced follicular lymphoma. Clinicians choosing a first-line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma should be cautious of secondary malignancies caused by immunochemotherapy and severe complications of infectious diseases in the long-term follow-up-both of which could lead to death.

AB  - To compare toxicity of etoposide bolus with continuous infusion and to assess the efficacy of the CEMP (cisplatinum, etoposide, mitoxantrone, prednisone) regimen, 47 patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma older than 60 years (n = 43) or not qualifying for high-dose chemotherapy (n = 4) received five four-weekly CEMP cycles. Patients were randomised to start with bolus or continuous-infusion etoposide and then received bolus and infusional etoposide in an alternating fashion. The primary objective was the comparison of differences in the course of leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia between the two application schedules. CEMP was well tolerated with little organ and moderate haematotoxicity. There was no difference in toxicity between bolus and continuous-infusion etoposide. Complete remission rate was 44% in patients relapsing >=1 year, 27% in patients relapsing within the first year after achieving complete remission and 5% in primary refractory patients. Median event-free and overall survivals for all patients were 3 and 10 months, respectively. The observed equitoxicity and the more challenging logistics of a 60-h infusion make bolus injection the preferred application of etoposide. As the CEMP regimen is well tolerated and efficacious in elderly patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for whom more aggressive therapies are not feasible, a three-weekly modification of CEMP should be tested in combination with rituximab. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

AB  - Patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia or aggressive lymphoma not only suffer from the direct side effects of chemotherapy such as infections due to long-lasting immuno-suppression and aplasia, but also from marked fatigue and the inability to do normal physical activity. Furthermore, especially in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia, doctors recommend abstaining from physical exercise due to the risk of potential bleeding and tissue damage. The normally recommended cutoff level to perform exercise is 50,000 platelets per microliter or haemoglobin of 8 g/dl. This leads to a vicious cycle of loosing physical strength and muscles with subsequent development of treatment-related cachexia and an increased treatment mortality. As number of publications focus on the importance of physical exercise in patients with solid tumours, increasing evidence is found that suggests positive effects on major clinical endpoints such as rate of infection, quality of life and even relapse rate and overall survival. With this work, we intended to address whether intense supervised ergometer training is feasible in patients with severe pancytopenia and whether it has any effect on patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study was initiated as the groundwork for a large phase III randomised trial. © 2009 The Japanese Society of Hematology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-transplantation (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-negativity is one of the strongest predictors of outcome after high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study, we assessed the feasibility and activity of PET-adapted salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin, followed by augmented ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). METHODS: In this non-randomised, open-label, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who had failed one previous doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen. All patients received weekly infusions of 1·2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin on days 1, 8, and 15 for two 28 day cycles. After completion of brentuximab vedotin treatment, patients received a PET scan. Patients who achieved PET-negative status (a Deauville score of 1 or 2) proceeded directly to HDT/ASCT; those with persistent abnormalities on PET received two cycles of augmented ICE (augICE; two doses of ifosfamide 5000 mg/m(2) in combination with mesna 5000 mg/m(2) continuous infusion over 24 h, days 1 and 2; one dose of carboplatin AUC 5, day 3; three doses of etoposide 200 mg/m(2) every 12 h, day 1) before consideration for HDT/ASCT. Only patients with persistent abnormalities on PET after brentuximab vedotin received augICE; however, all patients in the intention-to-treat population were assessed for the primary outcome, which was the proportion of patients who were PET-negative after brentuximab vedotin alone or brentuximab vedotin followed by augICE. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01508312, and is no longer accruing patients. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2012, and Oct 4, 2013, we enrolled 46 patients. One patient was deemed ineligible, and not evaluable, before treatment initiation owing to having nodular, lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma and thus 45 patients received treatment. After brentuximab vedotin, 12 patients (27%, 95% CI 13-40) were PET-negative and proceeded to HDT/ASCT. 33 (73%, 95% CI 60-86) patients were PET-positive after brentuximab vedotin; one PET-positive patient withdrew consent, therefore 32 PET-positive patients received augICE, 22 (69%, 95% CI 53-85) of whom were PET-negative. Overall, 34 patients (76%, 95% CI 62-89) achieved PET-negativity. All 44 patients who completed treatment as per protocol proceeded to receive HDT/ASCT. Brentuximab vedotin was well tolerated and associated with few grade 3-4 adverse events including hyperglycaemia (two [4%] patients, grade 3), nausea (one [2%], grade 3), hypoglycaemia (one [2%], grade 3 and one [2%], grade 4), and hypocalcaemia (one [2%], grade 3 and one [2%], grade 4). INTERPRETATION: PET-adapted sequential salvage therapy with brentuximab vedotin followed by augICE resulted in a high proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma achieving PET-negativity, and therefore could optimise the chance of cure after HDT/ASCT.

AB  - Introduction: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common subtypes of lymphoma in Western countries, accounting for 10-20% of all newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Clinical course of FL is typically indolent, with impressive responses to initial treatments. Nevertheless, frequent relapses with shorter remission duration occur that need additional therapeutic interventions and increase the risk of drug resistance. Treatment options for treatment-naive or recurring follicular lymphoma patients are still controversial, ranging from watch and wait to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. When a treatment is indicated, chemotherapy is usually prescribed. In most recent years, the advent of anti CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab (R) has dramatically changed the approach to this disease, and immunochemotherapy is at present considered the standard of care for patients diagnosed with high tumor burden FL, leading at advances in Progression Free Survival ( PFS) and Overall Survival(OS)1-3. Discussion(s): In order to prolong remission duration, the use of maintenance strategies after the first treatment has been considered over a long time. The use of interferon was first evaluated, showing benefits in terms of duration of remission and survival4; however, the safety profile of the drug and the low manageability of treatment has led most physicians to abandon this treatment option. The availability of rituximab as an effective and low toxic single agent has suggested to explore the possibility to use it not only to improve efficacy of chemotherapy in first line therapy, but also to delay progression after initial treatment reflecting the ideal maintenance strategy which involve clinical benefit, good tolerance and convenient administration. The PRIMA trial clearly showed that rituximab maintenance in patients achieving a response to initial chemoimmunotherapy results in an improved outcome in terms of prolonged PFS and made a step forward in the management of patients with FL5. However, one important question that can be raised is whether this approach is really needed for all patients with FL or if some of them could benefit from a risk adapted maintenance strategy, intensifying treatment in those recognized at high risk of recurrence, and reducing it in patients at lower risk. For example, in patients with low tumor burden who received front line rituximab, the RESORT study clearly showed that retreatment with rituximab instead rituximab maintenance was associated with an excellent outcome (86% chemotherapy free at 3 years), lack of Quality of Life difference and fewer rituximab doses required. 6 Recently, response to therapy assessed either with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) or with highly sensitive molecular techniques targeting the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (Minimal residual disease - MRD) have been suggested as important prognostic factors and are both identified as pivotal tools to achieve the goal of personalized treatment. The predictive value of PET and MRD is clearly recognized based on a large bulk of published evidence, and might be used to better tailoring post induction treatment in patients achieving satisfactory response with rituximab containing regimens. Post-induction FDG-PET provides powerful prognostic information in FL. About 80-85% of patients achieve a complete metabolic response (CMR) following immunochemotherapy and have an excellent outcome irrespective of whether rituximab maintenance is given (~95% survival at 6 years). In contrast, the ~15-20% of patients who fail to achieve a CMR are expected to have a significantly worse outcome.7, 8 Several studies indicate that, regardless to the treatment administered, the absence in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of neoplastic cells bearing the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement during the follow-up was strongly associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, clearly suggesting the need for MRD detection in FL 9-12 In the year 2012 the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) launched the prospective randomized FOLL12 trial, with the aim of verifying whether combining clinical response assessed on FDG-PET scan and molecular response measured through MRD detection could permit to single out patients at different risk of progression and to consequently modulate maintenance. In April, 2018 the planned accrual has been reached, with the accrual of 807 cases. Patients randomized to standard Arm received two years of rituximab maintenance according to the PRIMA schedule. Those in the experimental Arm and at low risk defined by post induction PET and MDR negativity, did not receive any further maintenance; however, 4 weekly doses of rituximab were allowed in case of MDR positivity during follow-up, for a maximum of three re-treatments. On the contrary, patients at high risk (post induction PET positive), received intensified maintenance with (90)Y Ibritumomab Tiuxetan followed by rituximab maintenance for 2 years. Some very preliminary analyses of the study will be presented at conference site. Conclusion(s): Despite rituximab maintenance has shown its beneficial effect in prolonging PFS, its ability in improving OS is still questionable. In this context we believe that the results of the FOLL12 study would provide a more rationale use of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic resources, thus offering the opportunity of better tailoring maintenance therapy in patients responding to first line chemoimmunotherapy.

AB  - Aims. Follicular lymphoma WHO grade I or II (FL) in early stage nodal disease can be treated effectively by radiotherapy alone. The extent of optimal target volumes remains controversial with a high rate of relapse (REL) out-field after Involved field irradiation, but higher toxicity and potentially risks of secondary neoplasia after large field techniques. Therefore, this study aimed to determine curative age-adapted irradiation volumes in younger [randomized trial (RD)] and standardized radiotherapy in elderly [prospective observation trial (OBS)] FL patients (pts). Methods. In FL stage I-II and limited stage III disease, pts<=65 years (ys) were randomized to Extended field (EF) or Total lymphatic irradiation (TLI), dose 30 Gy + boost 10 or 14 Gy. Pts aged 66-75 ys were treated with EF, all pts>75 ys with involved field (IF) radiotherapy. Results. A total of qualified 255 pts were recruited. In the RD trial, 202 pts were randomized to EF or TNI, median age 54 ys. In the OBS trial 53 pts, median age 70 ys, were treated with EF (79%) or IF (21%). At 5 ys after recruitment, overall survival of all pts is 97% at a median observation period of 77 months, relapse- (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are 60% and 60% at six years. Complete remissions (CR) were 93%, REL were 33%, median interval 27 months. In the RD pts, significant differences emerge in favor of TNI vs. EF treatment with PFS p=0.002 and RFS p=0.03. REL developed predominantly as new manifestations (92%, 77% new site alone), more often out-of than in-field. REL were entirely nodal (76%). New sites were in 75% located on the opposing side of the diaphragm. REL-histologies, revealing transition into secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 29% of biopsied pts (22% of all REL, 7% of all study pts), median 29 months from diagnosis. Secondary tumors were observed in 25 of all pts (10%) (8 EF-pts, 7 TNI-pts; 10 OBS trial-pts) and included AML/MDS (n=5), skin tumors (n=5), prostrate cancer (n=4), breast cancer (n=3), cancer of the oesophagus, the bladder, the stomach, the cervix uteri, angiosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease (<=2 cases each), at a median interval of 70 months. In the RD trial 14 pts (7%) died, 12/14 pts (86%) after progress/relapse and further diseases (8/9 in the EF, 4/5 in the TNI arm), and one each of myocardial infarction and sepsis. In the OBS trial three pts died (relapse/senile decay/MDS). Conclusions. In early stage nodal FL, standardized RT easily induced high rates of CR with excellent survival. In the randomised trial remission stability was significantly improved by TNI as opposed to EF, while the risk of secondary neoplasms was similar in both treatment arms. However, in the meantime, regional radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy has been evaluated in FL and molecular and cytogenetic factors may contribute to the identification of patients for these newer treatment approaches.

AB  - Anaemia is a common complication in the treatment of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but there are no published data on the effect of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in such patients. This is the first open-label, phase II, dose-finding study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.). Ninety-three anaemic patients with aggressive NHL who were receiving chemotherapy (including many advanced NHL, heavily pretreated patients) were randomised to receive 2.1, 4.2 or 6.3 mug/kg C.E.R.A. subcutaneously once every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Haematopoietic response was achieved in 45%, 57% and 65% of patients at the respective dose level. During weeks 5-13, the mean haemoglobin changes from baseline in the intent-to-treat population were increases of 0.2, 2.4, and 5.7 g/l in the 2.1, 4.2, and 6.3 mug/kg treatment groups, respectively, and 4.4, 5.7 and 6.8 g/l in the per-protocol population at the respective dose levels. C.E.R.A. was generally well tolerated in all three groups. C.E.R.A. appeared to have dose-dependent clinical activity in most anaemic patients with aggressive NHL who were receiving chemotherapy. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Intensive cytotoxic therapy with bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) allows a potential cure for haematological malignancies. Protective strategies to minimise haematological toxicities have been successful and currently toxicity to the gastro-intestinal tract is the major cause of treatment-related morbidity and the dose-limiting factor that prevents further dose escalation. In a randomised, placebo-controlled trial we investigated whether an oral immunoglobulin preparation (IgA-IgG) can diminish intestinal toxicity with autologous BMT. IgA-IgG (n = 6) and placebo (n = 7) were orally administered from 1 day prior to the start until 1 week after the termination of the cytotoxic treatment (a total of 14 days). Intestinal toxicity was assessed by a 51Cr-EDTA absorption test for intestinal permeability and by the clinical criteria laid down by the WHO for the period before the start of the cytotoxic treatment, 1 day prior to stem-cell infusion and 4, 7, 10 and 14 days after stem-cell infusion. In the placebo group there was a significant increase in intestinal permeability on day 4 (P < 0.005) and on day 7 (P < 0.05) after stem-cell infusion, compared with the baseline, which was not seen for IgA-IgG. In addition, patients receiving IgA-IgG had significantly less intestinal permeability on day 4 (P < 0.05) and on day 7 (P < 0.05), compared with the placebo group. No significant, positive effect as regards clinical toxicity was observed. Oral administration of IgA-IgG to patients undergoing intensive cytotoxic therapy prior to BMT seems to have a protective effect on the gut mucosa barrier which is normally disrupted by this therapy.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of patients with DLBCL who are unsuitable for anthracycline containing chemotherapy remains a clinical challenge. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue which has proven efficacy in the relapse setting in both non Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. We therefore developed a protocol incorporating Gemcitabine in a first line approach combined with CVP-R chemo-immunotherapy in DLBCL patients considered unfit for anthracycline containing chemotherapy. Method(s): We performed a prospective, multicentre phase II trial in patients with DLCBL who were considered unfit for anthracycline containing chemo-immunotherapy. Eligibility criteria included ejection fraction < 50%, or ejection fraction >= 50% but with the presence of attendant significant co-morbidities (including: ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus), and ECOG PS 0-3. Patients received 6 cycles of Rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV D1), Cyclophosphamide (750mg/m2 IV D1), Vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 IV D1), Prednisolone (100mg, orally D1-5) and Gemcitabine IV D1 and D8. The Gemcitabine dose, if tolerated was sequentially escalated from 750mg/m2 in cycle 1 to 875mg/m2 in cycle 2 to 1000mg/m2 in cycle 3 with the dose maintained at 1000mg/m2 for cycles 4-6. Cycles were repeated every 21 days with growth factor support administered on day 9 of each cycle (pegfilgrastrim 6mg s/c).The primary endpoint was to achieve an overall response rate of > 40% assessed by CT scan at the end of treatment according to the Cheson criteria. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival and overall survival. Result(s): 62 patients were recruited from 32 UK sites over a 28 month period from April 2008 to July 2010. 66% were male. Median age was 76 years (range 52-90), 48 (77%) were > 70 years. 43 (69%) had stage III/IV disease and 46 (72%) had high - intermediate or high IPI (3-5) disease. ECOG performance status was >= 2 in 50% patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was < 50% in 28 patients (45%). The 34 patients with LVEF >= 50% had significant co-morbidities, 22 (65%) had multiple co-morbidities. 44 (70%) received >= 3 cycles of treatment, reasons for early termination of treatment in the remaining 18 patients were progression (n=2), toxicity (n=5), death (n=6) patient choice (n=1) and other (n=4). 29 patients (47%) received the full 6 cycles. A total of 250 treatment cycles were delivered. Of the 44 patients who received >= 3 cycles of treatment, the dose of Gemcitabine was escalated to the full dose (1000mg/m2) in 67%. Day 8 Gemcitabine was delivered in 215/250 (86%) cycles of treatment. The overall response rate (CR/CRu/PR) at end of treatment for all 62 patients was 60%. For patients who received >= 3 cycles of treatment (n =44) the ORR was 79.5% at the end of treatment. There was no significant difference in ORR between those with LVEF <50% and those with LVEF >= 50% (71% vs 53%, p=0.155). At a median follow up of 18.2 months the 1 year progression free survival rate for all patients was 52.9% (95% CI 39.4-64.8). The 1 year overall survival (OS) rate is 62.4% (95% CI 48.5-73.6). For the group with LVEF <50% OS was 70.8% (95% CI: 48.4, 84.9) and LVEF group >= 50% OS was 55.9% (95% CI 37.1-71).Grade 3/4 haematological toxicity was observed in 54.1% patients. Grade 3/4 infection was observed in 24.6% of patients. The death rate observed related to infection for the whole cohort was 11%. Conclusion(s): This multicentre trial demonstrates that the R-GCVP regimen delivers excellent overall response rates with durable remissions in a group of patients where anthracycline use was precluded. The efficacy attained in this difficult group of patients provides a platform for testing the regimen in subsequent randomised phase II and phase III studies to confirm its efficacy.
