AB  - Purpose: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at risk for cognitive decline. Cross-sectional studies show patients' complaints of cognitive decline do not correlate well with concurrently measured objective neuropsychological performance, but rather with emotional variables and health-related quality of life. This longitudinal study investigated whether patient self-report of cognitive status would be concordant with objectively measured neuropsychological performance after accounting for change from their own pre-transplant objective baseline. Method(s): Pre-HSCT and at 30 and 100 days post-HSCT, 46 patients underwent computerized neuropsychological testing (CogState) and completed surveys assessing patient-reported cognitive complaints, emotional symptoms (depression, anxiety), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and physical and functional well-being. Correlations were calculated between cognitive complaints and neuropsychological performance (at each time-point and across time-points), as well as all other patient-reported variables. Result(s): Patient-reported cognitive complaints were largely independent of concurrently assessed objective neuropsychological performance. Uniquely, our longitudinal data demonstrated significant medium to large effect size associations between subjective cognitive complaints post-HSCT with objectively measured change from pre-HSCT in attention, visual learning, and working memory (p <.05-.01). Subjective cognitive complaints post-HSCT were also associated with depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness and physical well-being (p <.05-.001). Conclusion(s): Patients appear better able to assess their cognitive functioning relative to their own baseline and changes across time rather than relative to community norms. Thus, patient complaints of cognitive compromise justify further in-depth neuropsychological, emotional, and functional assessment. Future research into relationships between cognitive complaints and neuropsychological performance should account for changes in performance over time.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mucosal toxicity is dose limiting for etoposide. This may be related to the direct effects of etoposide on the mucosa. Twelve patients receiving etoposide 1800 mg/m2 as part of a myeloablative pre-transplant regimen were randomized to receive propantheline 30 mg or placebo orally every 6 h for six doses. Mucositis was less frequent (2 of 6 vs 5 of 6) and less severe (p = 0.05) in the propantheline arm. There were no differences in tumor response or survival between the two groups. Propantheline is an anticholinergic that causes xerostomia by decreasing salivation. Propantheline may reduce the salivary excretion of etoposide and could reduce its toxic effects on the mucosa. Propantheline is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients receiving high-dose etoposide.

AB  - Background: Effective DLBCL adjuvant therapy after first-line chemotherapy is needed as high-risk DLBCL is associated with a poor 4-year overall survival (OS) rate (Sehn et al, Blood 2007;109:1857-61). In a phase II study of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in relapsed, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL patients (n=47) had a 30% overall response rate (Witzig et al, Leukemia 2011;25:341-7). Method(s): PILLAR-2 is an ongoing international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study designed to compare everolimus efficacy and safety with that of placebo in poor-risk DLBCL patients who achieved complete response (CR) with first-line rituximab-based chemotherapy (R-chemo) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00790036 ; sponsor: Novartis Pharmaceuticals). Eligibility criteria include age 18 years; confirmed stage II bulky, III, or IV DLBCL and International Prognostic Index 3-5 at diagnosis; confirmed CR per revised International Workshop Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al, J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579-86) after first-line R-chemo regimen completed 6-14 weeks before study drug start; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2; no ongoing or post-R-chemo radiation; and no myelosuppressive chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 3 weeks. Patients are randomized 1:1 to everolimus 10 mg once daily or matching placebo and treated for 12 months or until disease relapse, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Radiologic tumor assessment is performed at baseline, every 12 weeks during years 1 and 2, every 24 weeks during years 3 and 4, and annually thereafter until start of new anticancer therapy or 5 years after last patient randomization. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints are OS, lymphoma-specific survival, and safety. Expected enrollment is 687 patients. Final analysis will be performed when 279 DFS events occur; survival follow-up will continue until 338 deaths occur and the last randomized patient has been followed for 5 years. Currently, 422 patients are enrolled. The data monitoring committee last reviewed the trial in July 2011 and recommended that it continue as planned.

AB  - Study question: This study aims to analyze alterations in proteomic profiles and validate selected protein biomarkers of spermatozoa in men with history of undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Summary answer: Cancer-associated protein was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis and database searching. And the protein was validated by Western-blotting. What is known already: As advanced cancer treatments have improved the prognosis of cancer survivors, these treatments such as chemotherapy have been known to cause harmful effect on fertile capacity. A few studies reported the alternation in proteins of spermatozoa between cancer patients and healthy donor and some proteins with different expression levels were identified between two groups. Study design, size, duration: This research is a cross-sectional cell-line research of control versus treatment. A group of patients with a history of anticancer drug administration in cancer diagnosis was assigned as 'cancer group'(n=3), and a fertile donor group was assigned as 'control group'(n=3). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and this study design was approved by institutional review board of Yokohama City University Medical Center. Participants/materials, setting, methods: The original diseases of cancer group were non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma(n=2) and soft tissue tumor(n=1). Measuring the total sperm count by CASA, they were adjusted to 6 million in all specimens, and protein concentration was adjusted by BCA assay. After trypsin digestion and desalting, the expressed proteins in spermatozoa were analyzed by LQ-MS/MS and database searching was performed in two groups. Validation was performed for the proteins with different expression levels by Western-blotting. Main results and the role of chance: A total of 1,152 proteins and 5,268 peptides were identified by global proteomics in both groups. Sorted by max fold change of expressions (>5 folds) and ANOVA (p<0.01), 29 proteins were identified. Of these identified proteins, we focused on one protein, which is cancer-associated protein highly expressed in digestive tract and urinary tract. In sperm of patients with cancer, this protein was overexpressed 54.8-folds more than that of fertile donor. This protein co-works with other protein of T-cell proliferation factor. Regimens of cancer chemotherapy patients in cancer group received were ABVD and IFM, ADM, and VCM therapy, respectively.By the Western-blotting, expression of this protein was validated. Limitations, reasons for caution: Limitations of this research was inability to compare the sperm before and after the administration of cancer chemotherapy, because spermatozoa were all cryopreserved for fertility preservation before treatment. Wider implications of the findings: It was speculated that T cell proliferation was induced by interaction between these proteins after induction of cancer chemotherapy. Functional analysis of these proteins would provide clue to the mechanisms of impaired spermatogenesis after cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: Haploidentical-cord blood transplantation is a promising approach for patients (pts) who lack HLA donors and may improve rates of early engraftment while allowing long term cord blood reconstitution with low rates of GVHD. We enrolled 29 pts (17 AML/MDS, 4 ALL, 3 CML, 4 NHL/HL, 1 severe aplastic anemia) lacking HLA identical donors. The median age was 40 years (range, 4-67), and median weight was 75 kg (range, 14-125). Twenty-two (76%) pts had active disease at time of transplant; 6 had prior autologous transplants. 14 pts were Caucasian; 15 were other race or ethnicity. The haploidentical donor was the mother in 4; father in 3; child in 10; sibling in 10; and half-sibling in 2 cases. The median haploidentical CD34+ dose was 2.51 x 106/kg (range, 1.25-10.95); CD3+ cells were 1.0 x 104/kg (range, 0.3-3.7). Single unrelated CB units were matched by low resolution at HLA-A and B and high-resolution at DRB1, and matched 6/6 in 2 pts; 5/6 in 18 pts; 4/6 in 9 pts. Median cord total nucleated cells equaled 1.93 x 107/kg (range, 1.07-9.36); CD34+ cells were 0.08 x 106/kg (range, 0.03-0.75). The conditioning regimen for 18 pts was fludarabine (Flu) (30 mg/m2 on d-7 through -3), melphalan (Mel) (70 mg/m2 on d -3 and -2), and Thymoglobulin (rATG) (1.5 mg/kg on d-7, -5, -3, -1). Eleven pts received Flu, thiotepa (5 mg/kg on d -7 and -6), total-body irradiation (TBI) (12 Gy lateral opposed fields in 2 Gy fractions BID on d-3 through -1), and rATG. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus (Tac) + methylprednisolone or Tac + mycophenolate. Engraftment: Two pts died early (sepsis, CVA). Three other pts failed to engraft with either haploidentical or CB and died of infection on d36, 43, and 63. One of these had anti-donor HLA antibodies. 24 pts engrafted with a median time to ANC >500/mL of 10 days (range, 9-31) and median time to sustained platelets >20,000/mL of 20 days (range, 15-63). In the majority of pts, early haploidentical engraftment was replaced by durable engraftment of CB by 100 days. However, 3 pts had persistent hematopoiesis associated with only the haploidentical donor, while a fourth pt engrafted with only CB on day 31. Late graft failure and death from sepsis occurred in one of the patients with haploidentical engraftment. In unfractionated peripheral blood or bone marrow cells, median haploidentical chimerism was 95% (range, 0-100) on d14; 76% (range, 0-95) on d30; 6% (range, 0-87) on d100. Median unfractionated cord chimerism was <5% (range, 0-100) on d14; 20% (range, 0-100) on d30; 85% (range, 0-100) on d100. In the CD3+ compartment, median haploidentical chimerism was 95% (range, 0-100) on d14; 86% (range, 0-95) on d30; 6% (range, 0-79) on d100. Median CD3+ cord chimerism was 5% (range, 0-100) on d14; 26% (range, 0-100) on d30; 90% (range, 1-100) on d100. Toxicities and outcome: Other fatal toxicities included VOD (1), EBV-associated PTLD (1), ARDS (1), cardiac arrest (1), intractable seizures (1). Two patients developed TTP and later died of complications related to sepsis. Five pts relapsed of whom 4 have died. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II occurred in 3 pts, one of whom developed the only case of chronic GVHD after failing to continue prograf. No aGVHD grade III-IV was seen. Twelve pts are currently alive; 11 are without disease. The median follow up for survivors is 186 days (range, 16-642). Estimated one year survival is 26% (95%CI, 6-46), and PFS is 19% (1-36). Conclusion(s): Combined haploidentical and CB transplantation results in early haploidentical engraftment followed by durable CB predominance in a majority of pts. The median times to neutrophil engraftment are considerably shorter - and the range narrower - than with other methods of cord blood transplantation. Early haploidentical engraftment failed in four patients; cord blood engraftment also failed in three of these pts and in three others. Rates of acute and particularly of chronic GVHD are low. Durable remissions can be achieved even in high risk pts regardless of age or remission status at the time of transplant.

AB  - Half-body irradiation at a single dose of 400-800 cGy was delivered to patients with disseminated fast-growing types of lymphomas and large aggregates of tumors and vital dysfunction of the body (the compression syndrome). Active detoxification therapy including heparinization, hemodilution with enforced diuresis and hemosorption was performed to prevent the syndrome of acute tumor lysis and postradiation complications. This treatment modality resulted in the elimination of clinical manifestations of the compression syndrome, normalization of the body homeostasis, a considerable reduction of the volume of tumor aggregates on a short-term basis, entering the patients into a curable state; the 5-year follow-up results were evaluated.

AB  - To circumvent aGVHD in the early phase after allogeneic stem cell transplantation but to provide GVL activity later on, we performed alloPBSCT with CD34+ selected grafts followed by delayed add-back of CD3+ T cells. Ten consecutive patients having an HLA-identical sibling donor were enrolled on to this trial. Four patients were in first CR of high-risk ALL, another four in first CR of AML, one was in second myeloid blast crisis of CML, and one was in PR of relapsed NHL. Conditioning consisted of 2 x 60 mg/kg CY plus 12 Gy TBI. G-CSF (Filgrastim) mobilized peripheral cells were CD34+ selected using the Isolex 300i system in nine patients and the CliniMacs system in one. Median CD34+ purity was 86%. A median of 2.8 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells were transplanted. The number of CD3+ cells in the allografts was 5.7 x 10(4)/kg (median) after Isolex 300i, and 0.2 x 10(4)/kg after CliniMacs. All patients received G-CSF (Filgrastim) and engrafted rapidly. Standard-dose CsA was administered, and until day +60 no aGVHD occurred. At that time point, seven patients received 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells while CsA had been tapered to 50% of the starting dose. One of these patients died after a second T cell boost given on day +90 without concomitant immunosuppression due to grade IV intestinal aGVHD. Three others developed cutaneous cGVHD. Taken together, T cell depletion by CD34+ selection does not impair rapid engraftment in the HLA-identical sibling donor setting. Using standard-dose CsA the risk for acute GVHD seems to be minimized. Add-back of 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells on day +60 with CsA protection is feasible. However, whether this is the optimal time point and number of T cells remain to be further elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hu5F9-G4 (hereafter, 5F9) antibody is a macrophage immune checkpoint inhibitor blocking CD47 that induces tumor-cell phagocytosis. 5F9 synergizes with rituximab to eliminate B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells by enhancing macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. This combination was evaluated clinically. METHOD(S): We conducted a phase 1b study involving patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients may have had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma. 5F9 (at a priming dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously, with weekly maintenance doses of 10 to 30 mg per kilogram) was given with rituximab to determine safety and efficacy and to suggest a phase 2 dose. RESULT(S): A total of 22 patients (15 with DLBCL and 7 with follicular lymphoma) were enrolled. Patients had received a median of 4 (range, 2 to 10) previous therapies, and 95% of the patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were anemia and infusion-related reactions. Anemia (an expected on-target effect) was mitigated by the strategy of 5F9 prime and maintenance dosing. Dose-limiting side effects were rare. A selected phase 2 dose of 30 mg of 5F9 per kilogram led to an approximate 100% CD47-receptor occupancy on circulating white and red cells. A total of 50% of the patients had an objective (i.e., complete or partial) response, with 36% having a complete response. The rates of objective response and complete response were 40% and 33%, respectively, among patients with DLBCL and 71% and 43%, respectively, among those with follicular lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months among patients with DLBCL and 8.1 months among those with follicular lymphoma, 91% of the responses were ongoing. CONCLUSION(S): The macrophage checkpoint inhibitor 5F9 combined with rituximab showed promising activity in patients with aggressive and indolent lymphoma. No clinically significant safety events were observed in this initial study.Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB  - Introduction: The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens enabled successful HCT in patients above 60 years. However, the impact of age on outcome in patients >60 years has not been evaluated extensively. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 104 consecutive patients (f=53, m=61) aged >60 who received allogeneic HCT 2000-2010 at our institution. Median age of the patients was 65 years (range, 61-76). Patients were grouped in two cohorts: group 1 aged 60-65 years (n=59, median age=63) and group 2 aged 66-76 years (n=45, median age=68). Diagnoses were acute leukemia (AML=63, ALL=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=13), osteomyelofibrosis (n=7), Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (n=7), multiple myeloma (n=8), aplastic anemia (n=1), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=2) and chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=2). At time of HCT 39 of the patients were in complete remission (CR), 65 in partial remission (PR). Conditioning regimens were grouped in high (TBI/Bu+Cy, n=5), intermediate (FLAMSA, Flu/Mel/BCNU, n=27), low (FLU+alkylans, n=44) and minimal (2GyTBI/Flu, n=28) intensity. Intermediate intensity conditioning was particularly used for high risk patients in PR (24/27 patients). 20 patients were transplanted from matched related (MRD), 45 from matched unrelated (MUD) and 39 from mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD). Result(s): Kaplan-Meier-estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) was 44% with a non-significant advantage for patients in CR vs. PR (51 vs. 40%, p=0.25). Non-relapse-mortality was 32%. The outcomes with intermediate, low and minimal intensity conditioning were comparable (3-year OS 50% vs. 47% vs. 46%) while all patients after high intensity conditioning died. HCT from MRD had an inferior OS compared to MUD or MMUD (3-year-OS 0% vs. 42 and 36% respectively for group 1, 33% vs. 73 and 65% respectively for group 2, not significant). Incidences of acute GVHD >=II, limited and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 12, 23 and 13%, respectively. Acute GVHD >=II was associated with inferior outcome (3-year OS of 18 vs. 41%, p=0.004). 3-year OS for group 1 and 2 were 30 and 67%, respectively (p=0.02). Patients in group 2 had a better outcome with low and minimal intensity vs. intermediate conditioning (3-year OS 84 and 70% vs. 51%, not significant). Conclusion(s): Age has no major impact on outcome of allogeneic HCT. Patient aged >60 seem to benefit from the use of MUD rather than an older MRD. The regimen used should be tailored to disease risk and patient performance status.

AB  - High-intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is an aggressive form of the disease, which can respond well to combination chemotherapy, with long-term survival seen in 40-50% of patients. When NHL relapses following standard treatment, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow support may still cure a significant proportion of patients. Despite a significant rise in the incidence of NHL over recent years, there remains only limited published economic study concerning the overall lifetime cost of treatment, the cost effectiveness of specific treatments or the overall societal cost burden of the disease. The majority of studies identified for the purposes of this review considered the cost of alternative forms of chemotherapy and bone marrow support strategies for patients with advanced disease. Data from these studies suggest that there is a definite trend towards reduced costs for high-dose therapy, possibly reflecting increasing technical experience and improved bone marrow recovery through the use of stem cell transplantation and growth factors. The limited number of cost-effectiveness evaluations suggest that high-dose therapy, following a chemosensitive relapse, is likely to be considered favourable against commonly quoted cost-effectiveness thresholds. Cost effectiveness is becoming an increasingly important factor to consider in the formal assessment of new interventions conducted by groups such as the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence. In light of the increasing incidence of NHL and the extended use of high-dose treatments in other subgroups of patients, there is a need for increased research into the economics of new interventions for NHL.

AB  - Introduction: Readmission is the main reason for failure in an at home-care program and also of patient's dissatisfaction. Neutropenic fever (NF) is the major extrahematological complication in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and a mandatory reason for readmission in most current home-care programs. Material (or patients) and methods: Between November 2000 and November 2015, 211 consecutive patients were managed at-home since day +1 of ASCT conditioned with BEAM, for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n = 136), and with standard dose of Melphalan for MM (n = 75). Antibacterial prophylaxis included levofloxacin 500 mg/d (p.o.) plus ceftriaxone 1 g/d (i.v.) or piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/ 8 h (i.v.). First-line therapy of NF was piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/6 h (i.v.) or refrigerated meropenem 1 g/8 h (i.v.) using a portable intermittent infusion pump for both drugs. Teicoplanin was added if oral mucositis of NCI-CTC-score grade >=2, signs of infection at the catheter insertion, or Gram-positive infection. Amikacin was started if fever persisted more than 3 days or in case of Gram-negative infection. Fever without hemodynamic instability responsive to first-line antibiotics was treated at-home. Only patients with NF and focal infection, persistent fever or signs of severe sepsis were readmitted. Result(s): Median age at transplantation was 48.6 (range, 17 to 69) years. All patients included had a good performance status (ECOG<=2). The quantity of peripheral blood CD34+ cell dose (x106/kg) infused was 3.9 (range, 1.5 to 21). Recovery (days) of granulocyte count above 0.5x109/l was 11 (range, 7 to 26). The global incidence of grades >=2 oral mucositis and gastrointestinal toxicity (NCI-CTC-score) was 21%. Of the 211 patients, 129 (61%) developed NF. Median day of appearance of fever was day +4 (range, day +2 to +13). Patients with fever received intravenous antibiotics for a median of 8 (range, 5 to 16) days, and teicoplanin and/or amikacin was added in 62 (48%) of the 129 febrile episodes. Bacterial infection was documented in 23 (18%) of febrile episodes. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci was the more frequent bacteria isolated (n = 17; 74%). The other infectious agents were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Streptococcus viridans (n = 1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). Of the 129 patients developing NF only 22 (17%) fulfilled criteria for readmission: pneumonia (n = 4), persistent fever (n = 15) and severe sepsis with hemodynamic instability (n = 3) requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit. Therefore, in 107 (83%) patients the NF was managed fully at-home and none of them died, while one (4.5%) of the patients readmitted died, which was due to respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (P=0.17). Readmission rate by NF in MM patients was constant over time (16%), while lymphoma patients autografted since March 2007 experienced a dramatic reduction of readmission rate with the use of piperacillintazobactam as primary antibacterial prophylaxis (15/62 (24%) vs. 1/31 (3%); P=0.02). Conclusion(s): In our home-care experience, NF per se is not a mandatory reason for readmission using simple clinical criteria. Likewise, the use of prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam reduces significantly the need for hospital readmission in lymphoma patients receiving BEAM, optimizing both domiciliary and hospital resources.

AB  - We report the remission of primary gastric lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type in two immunocompromised pediatric patients. Patient 1, a 14-year-old boy in an immunocompromised state of unknown cause, complained of repeated abdominal pain. Examinations revealed gastric MALT with local invasion and lymph node involvement. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) antibody was positive. H pylori eradication was abandoned due to its adverse effects. The MALT lesion spontaneously regressed over the next 24 months without any treatment for lymphoma. Patient 2, a 6-year-old boy, underwent cord blood transplantation for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy. He was administered immunosuppressants for graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. Nausea and hematochezia appeared and further examinations revealed gastric MALT with H pylori gastritis. Treatment consisting of medication for the Hpylori infection alone eradicated the H pylori and completely resolved the patient's MALT lesion, as well. Patients 1 and 2 were followed up over periods of 10 years and 3 years, respectively, without any signs of relapse. In conclusion, gastric lymphoma of the MALT type can be cured by conservative treatment even in immunocompromised pediatric patients. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Real-world practice patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), including the adoption of maintenance rituximab (MR) therapy in the United States (US), have been reported in few studies since the release of the National LymphoCare Study almost a decade ago. We analyzed data from the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), to identify rates of adoption and effectiveness of MR in FL patients after first-line (1L) treatment. We identified previously untreated patients with FL in the VHA between 2006 and 2014 who achieved at least stable disease after chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy. Among these patients, those who initiated MR within 238 days of 1L composed the MR group, whereas those who did not were classified as the non-MR group. We examined the effect of MR on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 676 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 300 received MR. MR was associated with significant PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55, P <.001) and OS (HR = 0.53, P =.005) compared to the non-MR group, after adjusting by age, sex, ethnicity, geographic region, diagnosis period, stage, grade at diagnosis, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 1L treatment regimen, and response to 1L treatment. These results suggest that in FL patients who do not experience disease progression after 1L treatment in real-world settings, MR is associated with a significant improvement in both PFS and OS. Maintenance therapy should be considered in FL patients who successfully complete and respond to 1L therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We studied the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 220 mg/m2 melphalan (HDM 220) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in 16 patients with advanced haematological malignancies. Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean values of steady-state volume of distribution 14.6 l/m2, total body clearance 313 ml/min/m2, elimination half-life 46 min) were the same as those of 140 or 200 mg/m2 melphalan in previous reports. HDM 220 was feasible. Extramedullary toxicity was mainly W.H.O. grade 4 mucositis (13/16 patients). The median duration of 41 d (10, not reached) of thrombocytopenia < 25 x 10(9)/l was long. In multiple myeloma the response rate was 89% in heavily pretreated patients, suggesting that HDM 220 could be considered earlier in the course of the disease as an alternative consolidation therapy.

AB  - Disseminated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy regimens, and more than 50% of patients die within 5 years of their first relapse. Therefore, newer treatment approaches have been used to try to improve survival and ultimately provide a cure for patients with disseminated indolent NHL. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been extensively evaluated and is now an integral component of many treatment strategies. The activity of rituximab was first shown in the pivotal trial in patients with relapsed and refractory low-grade and follicular lymphoma. More recent studies have shown somewhat higher activity of rituximab when used first-line, with further improvements with maintenance therapy. Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to achieve high response rates, and two prospective randomized studies from the German Low-grade Lymphoma Study Group have shown significantly higher response rates and longer survival for patients receiving rituximab concurrently with chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Further data from ongoing phase III studies are still needed to determine whether rituximab can help alter the natural history of indolent NHL, and longer follow-up of these patients will help determine the optimal role for rituximab in treatment of indolent NHL. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation was assessed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients with resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive) who received obinutuzumab- or rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy in the phase 3 GOYA and GALLIUM studies. HBV DNA monitoring was undertaken monthly to 1 year after the last dose of study drug. In case of HBV reactivation (confirmed, HBV DNA ++29 IU/mL), immunochemotherapy was withheld and nucleos(t)ide analog treatment (preemptive NAT) started. Immunochemotherapy was restarted if HBV DNA became undetectable or reactivation was not confirmed, and discontinued if HBV DNA exceeded 100 IU/mL on NAT. Prophylactic NAT was allowed by investigator discretion. Among 326 patients with resolved HBV infection, 27 (8.2%) had HBV reactivation, occurring a median of 125 days (interquartile range, 85-331 days) after the first dose. In 232 patients without prophylactic NAT, 25 (10.8%) had HBV reactivation; all received preemptive NAT. Ninety-four patients received prophylactic NAT; 2 (2.1%) had HBV reactivation. No patients developed HBV-related hepatitis. On multivariate Cox analysis, detectable HBV DNA at baseline was strongly associated with an increased risk of reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.04-54.93; P < .0001). Prophylactic NAT was strongly associated with a reduced risk (adjusted HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41; P 5 .0018). HBV DNA monitoring-guided preemptive NAT was effective in preventing HBV-related hepatitis during anti-CD20-containing immunochemotherapy in B-cell NHL patients with resolved HBV infection. Antiviral prophylaxis was also effective and may be appropriate for high-risk patients. These trials were registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01287741 (GOYA) and NCT01332968 (GALLIUM).Copyright © 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - Nutrition assessment and management of a patient with cancer is complicated by physiologic abnormalities associated with the tumor, adverse effects of cancer treatment, and weight changes that may occur before, during, and/or after treatment. Food intolerances and alterations in metabolism and hypercatabolism affect timely administration of nutrition support. In older patients, it is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, frailty, and cognitive concerns. Few evidence-based guidelines exist to direct nutritional care and evaluation of nutrition outcomes in patients with cancer. A case study of an elderly patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is reviewed, with emphasis on available evidence-based nutrition prevention and support recommendations.

AB  - Background: Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade have separately shown efficacy in some lymphoid malignancies, the safety of allo-SCT after anti-PD-1 therapy in these patients remains a high clinical interest. Aim(s): We present data from an analysis from 4 KEYNOTE phase 1-3 studies to describe predetermined complications in patients who received allo-SCT following pembrolizumab therapy. Method(s): The analysis included patients from the KEYNOTE-013 (NCT01953692, n=20), KEYNOTE-087 (NCT02453594, n=31), KEYNOTE-170 (NCT02576990, n=5), and KEYNOTE-204 (NCT02684292, n=14) trials who have a known allo-SCT transplantation date received within 2 years of the last dose of study pembrolizumab. Descriptive statistics were used for predefined post-allo-SCT complications of interest. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute grade 3-4 GVHD, and chronic GVHD was estimated. The corresponding competing risk events were death without acute grade 2-4 GVHD, death without acute grade 3-4 GVHD, and death without chronic GVHD, respectively. The cumulative incidence of post-allo-SCT transplantrelated mortality (TRM) was estimated with relapse as a competing risk. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventy patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 30 y (range, 18-65), 57 (81.4%) had classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), and the rest had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 69 of 70 (98.6%) patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy; 1 patient received pembrolizumab + lenalidomide. Median duration on study treatment was 5.3 months (range, 0.7-29.6) and median time from last pembrolizumab dose to first allo-SCT was 4.6 months (range, 1-20). Before transplantation, 49 patients (70.0%) had intervening anticancer regimen; 34 (48.6%) had active disease, 31 patients (44.3%) were in remission at time of transplant, and 5 patients (7.1%) had unknown disease status. Overall, 55 patients (78.6%) developed GVHD (acute, 38; chronic, 17). The estimated 6-month post-allo-SCT cumulative incidence was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.30-0.53) for grade II-IV acute GVHD and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.12-0.30) for grade III-IV acute GVHD; 1 year post-allo-SCT was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12-0.31) for chronic GVHD. Other predetermined complications, including critical illness, immune-mediated adverse events, pulmonary complications, and veno-occlusive liver disease, occurred in 32 patients (45.7%). After a median follow-up (defined as the time from allo-SCT to data cutoff) of 40.1 months (range, 5.1-71.2), the post-allo-SCT median PFS was not reached (NR) (95% CI, 14.5-NR) and the 30-month post-allo-SCT PFS rate was 56.8% (95% CI, 42.9-68.5) (Figure A); median OS was NR (95% CI, NR-NR) and the OS rate at 12 months was 82.2% (Figure B). The estimated post-allo-SCT cumulative incidence for TRM at 6 months was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.03-0.17) and for relapse at 26 months was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.16- 0.38). PFS and OS outcomes were comparable in the subgroup of patients with cHL. Summary/Conclusion: The incidence of GVHD in this population is comparable to historical data (40%-80% and 30%-70%, respectively). The incidence of severe acute GVHD may be higher than a typical modern allo-SCT series, although TRM was low. The observed PFS and OS outcomes compare favorably to historical benchmarks (2-year PFS ranging from 45%-48%; 1-year OS >80%). Altogether, this analysis lends confidence that allo-SCT is feasible for patients with lymphoid malignancies after PD-1 blockade. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the results of the diagnostic imaging modalities, especially ultrasonography (US) in children during the oncological therapy with the acute abdominal symptoms. Acute abdominal symptoms in children with neoplasms causing a very difficult clinical and diagnostic problems and can occure in any stage of disease. Materials/Methods: We analyzed 249 ultrasounds examinations of the abdominal cavity in 144 girls and 105 boys aged from 1 to 18 years (mean age 1o, 3 years). The more important indication for the US exam in 133 cases was acute abdominal symptoms. We took exams during pre- and postoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy and after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. All the patients were under routine hematological control. Based on the clinical symptoms and the laboratory tests we analysed two groups of children with oncological disease and acute abdomen: I group-111 children with neutropenia, II group-22 children without neutropenia. In the patients who underwent operation procedure the final diagnosis was established on histopathology. In the other cases diagnosis was based on clinical, laboratory and radiological exams, especially ultrasonography. We analyzed clinical picture of disease, the results of therapy and the US changes in examed patients using statistic parameters as: sensitivity, specificity and efficiency. Result(s): In the group of 133 children with acute abdominal symptoms the most (92-69,1%) patients suffer from ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and 16(12%) - from AML (acute lympoblastic leukaemia), Ewing sarcoma-3(2,2%), osteosarcoma-3(2,2%), NHL-8(6,0%), HL-4(3%), nephroblastoma-4(3%), neuroblastoma-3 (2,2%). Acute abdominal symptoms can have a very different etiology: bacterial, mycotic and virusal infections or continious infiltration of gastrointestinal tract by tumor. Clinical symptoms of the acute abdominal diseases are very severe, because the oncological patients usually have immunologic deficiency and oblige us to proper clinical observation or to operation procedure, very often as an emergency. The symptoms appeard in the different time of course of oncological diseases. Nonspecific gastrointestinal inflammation with haemorrhage and typhlitis were the main cause of the acute abdominal pain in 71 children with neutropenia during therapy of leucaemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The accuracy of ultrasound findings verified intraoperatively and by histopathologic examinations was 84%. In all cases the morphological changes were directly related to the signs and symptoms duration. Conclusion(s): The high-resolution ultrasound has a very important role in diagnosis in all patients with acute abdominal pain and with neoplasms. The authors consider that the US should be the first imaging method in the differential diagnosis of the abdominal changes in children with neutropenia and oncological disease. Proper diagnosis should be established only with clinical information.     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 0.194068009844173     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Thirteen patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma were treated with 131I-Lym-1 during the course of a dose escalation trial. Principal aims were to establish the maximum tolerated single dose (MTD), as well as to assess clinical and dosimetric effects of the MTD. Patients were eligible if >25% of tumor cells bound Lym-1 on immunohistochemistry, stain intensity was +2/4 or greater and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) assay was negative. Radioimmunotherapy was performed with escalating doses at levels of 50 mCi, 65 mCi/m2 and 80 mCi/m2 (50-139 mCi total). Patients were eligible for retreatment after 6-10 weeks if there was no severe toxicity, their disease was at least stable and HAMA remained negative. Three were retreated. Four have achieved partial responses which lasted 11, 11, 18 and 22 weeks. Acute toxicities included rigors (69%), fever (62%), nausea (46%), vomiting (46%), pruritus (23%), urticaria (23%), chest pain (23%) and bronchospasm (15%). HAMA developed in 3 patients. Myelosuppression, manifested as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, was dose-limiting and defined the single dose MTD at 65 mCi/m2. Plasma radioactivity clearance was biphasic, with a 0.9 hr alpha-T( 1/2 ) and a 19.8 hr beta-T( 1/2 ). At completion of Lym-1 infusion, a mean of 45% of the injected dose was recoverable in the circulation. Images obtained within the first 2 hours indicated mean hepatic and splenic uptake was 29% and 11%, respectively. Radiation absorbed doses to tumor ranged from 18-61 rads; mean doses to whole body ranged from 17 to 71 rads.

In addition, the feasibility of a response adapted approach using FDG-PET/CT regarding success (PFS, rates of remission, analysis of recurrences) and safety in combination with Gazyvaro will be assessed. The results will be historically compared to the results of the MIR trial regarding morphologic response in week 7 and the quality of life (secondary endpoints). Additional secondary endpoints are PFS, the site of recurrences in the three subgroups (1. PET negative after initial staging; 2. PET negative in week 18; 3. PET positive in week 18). Primary Evaluation of the rate of metabolic CR after low-dose involved site radiotherapy in combination with Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) in early stage nodal follicular lymphoma in order to avoid conventional full dose IF radiotherapy. ;Secondary Objective: Secondary Efficacy and safety of a response adapted radiation dose treatment schedule. ;Primary end point(s): Metabolic complete response (CR) in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by FDG-PET/CT;Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: in week 18     Secondary end point(s): • Morphologic CR, PR, SD, PD in week 7, week 18 and month 6 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by CT/MRI &#x0D; • Historical comparison of the morphologic response with MIR data (using MabThera); The comparison of the CR rate in week 7 will allow for a comparison of the two different CD20 antibodies. Due to the restricted patient numbers no matched pair analysis will be possible&#x0D; • Progression free survival (PFS) of all treated patients (2 years after individual treatment start)&#x0D; • Toxicity (NCI-CTC criteria, version 4.03) of all patients&#x0D; • Relapse rate and pattern of recurrence of all treated patients at all follow-up visits.&#x0D; • Overall survival (OS) of all treated patients (2 years)&#x0D; • Quality of life according EORTC QLQ C30 and FACT-Lym questionnaires at inclusion and in week 18, month 12, and 24 (all treated patients)&#x0D; • MRD response in peripheral blood: initially, week 18, months 6, 12, 18 and 24 (all treated patients). MRD is evaluated by the laboratory of C. Pott (Kiel) using at least the markers: t(14:18) PCR for MBR, 3’mbr, 5’mcr and MCR; clonal IGH rearrangements (FR1-3); clonal IGL rearrangements (IGK and Kappa-KDE);Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: • Morphologic CR, PR, SD, PD in week 7, week 18 and month 6&#x0D; • Historical comparison of the morphologic response with MIR data in week 7 &#x0D; • Progression free survival 2 years after individual treatment start&#x0D; • Relapse rate and pattern of recurrence at all follow-up visits&#x0D; • Overall survival (OS) (2 years)     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 1.20718006653812     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1
