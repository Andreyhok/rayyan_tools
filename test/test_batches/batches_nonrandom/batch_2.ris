AB  - Personalized medicine aims to match the right drug with the right patient by using specific features of the individual patient's tumor. However, current strategies of personalized therapy matching provide treatment opportunities for less than 10% of patients with cancer. A promising method may be drug profiling of patient biopsy specimens with single-cell resolution to directly quantify drug effects. We prospectively tested an image-based single-cell functional precision medicine (scFPM) approach to guide treatments in 143 patients with advanced aggressive hematologic cancers. Fifty-six patients (39%) were treated according to scFPM results. At a median follow-up of 23.9 months, 30 patients (54%) demonstrated a clinical benefit of more than 1.3-fold enhanced progression-free survival compared with their previous therapy. Twelve patients (40% of responders) experienced exceptional responses lasting three times longer than expected for their respective disease. We conclude that therapy matching by scFPM is clinically feasible and effective in advanced aggressive hematologic cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first precision medicine trial using a functional assay to instruct n-of-one therapies in oncology. It illustrates that for patients lacking standard therapies, high-content assaybased scFPM can have a significant value in clinical therapy guidance based on functional dependencies of each patient's cancer.Copyright ©2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Introduction. Marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) represent a heterogeneous group of indolent lymphomas arising from memory B lymphocytes within the marginal zone of the secondary lymphoid follicles. MZLs develop in spleen and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), rarely in lymph nodes. The updated WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms grouped MZLs in three specific subtypes: extranodal MZL (EMZL) or MALT type, splenic MZL (SMZL) and nodal MZL (NMZL). Due to the heterogeneity and rarity of these lymphomas, a risk stratified approach is currently lacking. Our study aims to identify whether integration of several clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters may correlate with the outcome of the different MZL subtypes. Materials and Methods. 19 patients (11 females and 8 males), aged between 38 to 84 years, with diagnosis of MZL, were evaluated. Histological subtypes were represented as follows: 12 patients (63.2%) with EMZL [site distribution: stomach (3), lung (3), parotid gland (3), orbit (2) and skin (1)]; 6 NMZL (31,6%) and 1 SMZL (5,2%). At the time of diagnosis, all patients underwent evaluation of basal parameters: clinical and pathology data (sex, age, stage, IPI, histological subtype, Ki67); blood count, LDH, b2-microglobulin and inflammatory markers (ESR, RCP, D-dimer and ferritin); morphological (ultrasound, CT or MRI) and functional (PET/CT) imaging scans (Table 1). PET/CT scans were performed in 15 out of 19 patients; FDG avidity expressed as SUV max was evaluated and included. In case of multiple lesions with different FDG avidity, the higher SUVmax in the patient was considered for statistical analysis. 15 out of 19 patients underwent standard treatments for MZL (steroids, antibiotics, immunotherapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery). At the end of treatment, reevaluation was performed in 12 of the 15 treated patients. The statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS package. Results. Due to the presence of only one SMZL patient in the whole group, we decided to exclude this subtype and to compare EMZL (12 patients) versus NMZL (6 patients) groups (Table 1). The analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of basal platelets count (147330 vs 259000 cells/mmc, NMZL vs EMZL respectively, p=0.018) and basal SUVmax (3.30 vs 8.28 NMZL vs EMZL respectively, p=0.040). Notably, we found lower ESR values in the NMZL group (6.60 mm/h) compared with the EMZL one (27.00 mm/h) without reaching statistic significance (p=0.100). All the other parameters evaluated did not show significant differences. Conclusions. We found a close correlation between EMZL subtype, level of platelet count and SUVmax. These data suggest that increased PET avidity may depend on marked systemic inflammatory stimuli triggered by EMZL rather than NMZL diseases. Further investigations with an enlarged cohort of patients will be needed to confirm these data and to design an integrated score for risk stratification of MZLs. (Table Presented).

AB  - The prognostic role of TP53 disruption has been established in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Aim of this analysis was to correlate TP53 mutations by Sanger sequencing, cell of origin (COO) profile by Lymph2Cx panel on the NanoString platform and MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 overexpression or re-arrangements by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), with outcome in DLBCL patients enrolled into the FIL-DLCL04 trial (NCT00499018). One hundred and twenty-five DLBCL patients with tumour block available were analyzed. TP53 was mutated in 11/125 (9%) cases; 60/125 patients received high-dose chemoimmunotherapy up-front, as for the randomization arm; COO was reported in 88 patients: 48 germinal centre B-cell like, 25 activated B-cell like and 17 unclassified; 26 patients were double expressors in IHC and 11 double hit in FISH. After a median follow-up of 72 months, five-year failure-free survival (FFS) for TP53 mutated versus wild-type was 24% and 72%, and five-year overall survival (OS) was 34% and 83%, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 2·28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·89-5·86, p = 0·086] and 4·05 (95% CI 1·37-11·97, p = 0·011) for FFS and OS, respectively. In this series of young DLBCL patients, TP53 gene mutation identified a poor prognosis subgroup, regardless of treatment and other biological markers.

AB  - Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are frequently used following haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with a high risk of relapse. Limited data are available on the characteristics of GVHD in this setting. The aim of this study is to investigate the NIH type, severity, treatment and response rates of GVHD following DLI. Consecutive patients receiving DLI at 4 transplantation centres in the UK were identified since 2006. Data were collected retrospectively to include diagnosis, date of transplant, dates and doses of DLI, onset of GVHD, treatment of GVHD, follow up (FU) and outcome. 58 patients were identified having received DLI. The mean age at HSCT was 55yrs (median 45, range 20-70). Haematological malignancies were AML in 22, MDS in 9, CML in 7, myeloma in 5, CLL in 5, NHL in 3 and other in 7. 33 received matched related and 25 unrelated donor transplants. The reason cited for DLI was pre-emptive (mixed chimerism) in 30, therapeutic in 28 (relapse in 18, molecular relapse in 6, cytogenetic abnormality in 3 and consolidation in 1). DLI was given at a mean of 14 months after HSCT (median 7, range 1-65). DLI dose ranged from 1x105-1x107 CD3+ cellskg-1. The number of doses ranged from 1-8, mean 2.3, median 2. 43 patients had GVHD after DLI (acute in 16, chronic in 26 and overlap in1). In aGVHD skin was the most common organ involved in 13/16 patients, followed by liver in 7, and gut in 6. 9/16 had single organ involvement (7 skin only, 2 liver only). 3 patients had skin and gut and 4 skin, gut and liver. In 6 patients this was severe (grade III-IV aGVHD). Of the 27 with cGVHD the most common organ involved in decreasing order was skin (n=20), oral (n=16), liver (n=9), eye (n=6), gut (n=4) and lung (n=1). 9 patients had single organ involvement (skin only in 6, oral 2, eye 1). 12 patients had 2, 2 had 3, 2 had 4 and 2 had five organs involved. 8 patients had cGVHD recorded as severe. The mean time between first DLI doses and development of aGVHD was 2 months (median 1, range 1-5 months) and 5.7months (median 3, range 1-28) in cGVHD. First treatment of aGVHD was oral prednisolone in all 16 patients: first treatment response was CR in 4/16, relapse in 4 and progressive GVHD in 8. 5 died (2 from relapse, 2 from aGVHD and 1 from pneumonia). 5 with progressive GVHD received a 2nd line therapy (ECP in 3, tacrolimus in 1 & MMF in 1). 2 patients had a CR, 1 patient relapsed and died, 1 has ongoing mild GVHD and the other had 3rd line therapy with ECP and a PR. The 1st treatment in cGVHD was oral prednisolone in 16/27 (prednisolone alone in 12, plus CyA in 2, tacrolimus in 1, MMF in 1). 9 received topical steroids only, 1 received MMF and 1 rituximab. 16/27 patients had a CR to first line therapy, 1 died of severe lung GVHD and 1 relapsed. 9 received a 2nd line therapy (ECP in 4, MMF in 3, imatinib in 1 and infliximab in 1). 1 had CR, 7 had PR and 1 relapsed. 4 had a 3rd line therapy (ECP in 2 and MMF in 2) of which 1 had CR and 3 PR. I further patient had a 4th therapy with ECP and a PR. Of 8 patients with severe cGVHD 1 had 1 therapy (and died), 4 had 2, 2 had 3 and 1 had 4 therapies: 7/8 are alive, 4 in remission with GVHD, 2 in remission without GVHD and 1 relapsed. Mean FU for cohort is 51.7 months (median 45, range 5-124) post HSCT. 35 are in remission, 11 of whom are receiving treatment for GVHD (4 with severe cGVHD). 18 patients relapsed (7 are receiving treatment and 11 died). In total 16/58 died and causes were relapse (11), severe GVHD (3, 2x aGVHD,1x cGVHD), ruptured aortic aneurysm (1) and pneumonia (1). 7/30 (23%) patients receiving DLI for mixed chimerism died compared to 9/18 (50%) receiving DLI for relapse. Overall survival in those developing aGVHD and cGVHD was 63% and 74% respectively compared to 12/15 (80%) in those without GVHD. Death from relapse was similar in those with and without GVHD post DLI at 20% and 26% respectively and death rates in those with severe GVHD do not appear higher. We report on 58 patients receiving DLI after HSCT. 74% developed GVHD which was severe in 24%. In the majority of patients developing GVHD after DLI successful treatment may be achieved with increased immunosuppression. 39% of patients received second line therapy for GVHD most commonly ECP. 21% received a third line therapy. 16/58 patients have died (28%) including 3 (5%) of GVHD. The most common cause of death was relapse in 19%. In summary patients develop both aGVHD and cGVHD post DLI and may require consecutive therapies but mortality from GVHD is infrequent.

AB  - Plerixafor (P) in combination with filgrastim (F) is currently approved for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). F + P is a very expensive but reduces the incidence of mobilization failure. In an effort to utilize P in a cost efficient manner, we employed a risk adaptive strategy of using P only in patients who are at high risk of mobilization failure defined by peripheral blood CD34+ cell (pCD34) count of < 10/muL after 4 days of F alone. In this study we present the results of efficacy and an estimate of cost of such a risk adaptive strategy for autologous peripheral blood HPC collection. 42 patients with history ofNHL orMMundergoing peripheral blood HPCmobilization fromFebruary toDecember 2009 were included in the analysis. All patients received daily filgrastim for 4 days. Our risk adaptive approach was to add P for those 'at-risk' patients, who on day 4 had a pCD34 count of < 10/muL, with apheresis commencing the following morning. Morning administration of F and evening dosing of P was continued daily in this group of 'at-risk' patients for up to amaximumof 4 days or until. > 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were collected. Results of consecutive patients who had peripheral blood HPC mobilization were prospectively collected. A decision analytic model was created to estimate the mean cost and effectiveness rates in patients who underwent mobilization with F versus F + P. 18 patients were mobilized with F alone and 24 patients required F + P. Administration of P was safe and no severe adverse events were recorded. Addition of P increased the pCD34 count by 6.8 fold with an average total yield of 4.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. The frequency of poor mobilization among F only and F + P patients was 25%and 7% respectively. The pooled average cost benefit for mobilization with F + P may be up to $ 16,900 per patient and could potentially increase the annual number of transplants by more than 18%. Following autologous stem cell infusion, days to neutrophil and platelet engraftments were similar between the patients who mobilized HPC with F versus F + P (p = 0.12). These results suggest that addition of P to F based on a risk adaptive strategy significantly reduces the frequency of mobilization failures and is also cost effective. Addition of P to F forHPC mobilization has no significant impact on the neutrophil and platelet engraftment.

AB  - Introduction The availability of HLA matched donors remains a major obstacle for successful allogeneic hematotopoietic cell transplantation. The use of HLA-mismatched alternate donors such as cord blood and haploidentical donor stem cell sources have allowed for greater access for those patients who need an allo-HSCT but lack a suitable matched sibling or unrelated donor. Introduction of high dose cytoxan in the early post-transplant period has significantly improved the outcomes of patients undergoing haploidentical transplantation and has eliminated the need for expensive and labor-intensive ex-vivo T cell depletion. Encouraging results have been reported using this platform with bone marrow as the source of stem cells. However, there have been only limited reports using this transplant platform with G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a source of stem cells for haloidentical transplantation. Here we report the outcomes of 18 patients who underwent haploidentical transplant for hematological malignancies from single institution treated on the Hopkins non-meloablative conditioning regimen but with G-CSF mobilized PBSC as a source of stem cells from a haplo-identical family donor. Patients and Methods A total of 18 patients (median age 41 years, range 22-73 years, 11 males and 7 females) between July 2009 and June 2013 underwent haploidentical transplant at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis using the Hopkins non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with post transplant cytoxan (fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day on days -6 to -2), cytoxan (14.5 mg/kg/day on days -6 and -5) and TBI (single dose at 200cGy on day -1) and all these patients received two doses of post-transplant cytoxan (50mg/kg on D+3 and D+4). G-CSF mobilized PBSC from parents (n=9) or siblings (9) were used as a graft source with median CD34+ cell dose of 5.0 x 106/kg and median CD3+ T cell dose of 19.7 x 107/kg. GVHD prophylaxis regimen included MMF plus tacrolimus (16/18 patients) or MTX plus tacrolimus (2/18 patients). Median follow-up of all patients was 251 (range 17-1174) days. Diagnoses included AML (n=12), ALL (n=2), NHL (n=2), CLL (n=1) and aplastic anemia (n=1). 7 out of 12 AML patients underwent transplant with active disease (not in remission) and 4/18 of these patients had prior history of allogeneic HCT. Results 16 patients (89%) engrafted (> 95% donor chimerism), median time to neutrophil engraftment was 15 days (range: 12-28 days) and median time to platelet engraftment was 18 days (range: 11-40 days). None of these patients had secondary graft failure. 1-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 62% and 100-day and 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were 11% and 17% respectively. Both 1-year and 2-year relapse free survival (RFS) rates were 53%. Despite very high CD3+ T cell doses, cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 40.7% while grade III-IV aGvHD occurred in only 3 patients (17%). Cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 2 years were both at 8% (extensive in only 1 patient). CMV reactivation occurred in 11 patients (61%) but did not significantly impact their survival or relapse rates and none of these patients developed CMV disease. Conclusions Here we report the outcomes of 18 patients with hematologic malignancies or marrow failure states undergoing haploidentical transplant using the published Hopkins NMA conditioning platform with post-transplant high dose cytoxan and with G-CSF mobilized PBSC as a source of donor stem cells. In spite of the limited numbers of patients transplanted, our results suggest that this approach is both safe and effective and associated with rapid multilineage engraftment, low rates of both aGvHD and cGvHD and encouraging overall and disease-free survival rates and low rates of NRM. Based on these results, 1) G-CSF mobilized PBSC from haploidentical donors should be considered as an alternative source of haploidentical stem cells to BM and 2) future randomized trials using this platform to test the role of haploidential G-CSF mobilized PBSC with other unrelated donor stem cell sources (cord blood and matched unrelated could also be considered in the future.

AB  - Background: High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has become the standard of care for patients with relapsed chemo-sensitive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Various conditioning regimens have been developed to improve outcome, but no regimen has proven superior. We compare the outcomes of Carmustine, Etoposide, Cytarabine, Melphalan (BEAM) used at the Ohio State University to that of Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide (BUCYVP16) used at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Aim(s): To compare the efficacy and toxicity of BEAM and BUCYVP16 conditioning regimens in patients with relapsed NHL undergoing AHSCT. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed patients treated with BEAM (n=269) or BUCYVP16 (n=409) followed by AHSCT between 2006 and 2014. Kaplan- Meier estimates were used to analyze progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was measured from transplant date until relapse, treating deaths as competing risks using Pepe and Mori test. Result(s): Patient characteristics were similar for age (median 60 (20-77) vs 58 (27-78)), disease stage at diagnosis (p=0.29), prior radiation exposure (p=0.68), and response status at transplant (94.7% CR/PR vs 93.2%) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16 respectively. Differences were number of prior treatments (median 2 (1-8) vs 2 (1-13), p<0.01), comorbidity index (74.0% 0-3 vs 80.9%, p=0.03), and median CD34 dose infused (4.3 vs 6.02, p<0.01) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16. Median follow-up from diagnosis and transplant was 6.6 years and 4.0 years respectively for BEAM and 7.0 years and 4.3 years for BUCYVP16. Median day to neutrophil engraftment was 10 (8-19) vs 10 (9-15) (p<0.01) and median time to platelet engraftment was 18 (11-69) vs 16 (3-129) (p<0.01) for BEAM vs BUCYVP16. There were no statistical differences in CIR, PFS or OS. At 1, 3 and 5 years from AHSCT, PFS was 75%, 59%, and 46% vs 72%, 54%, and 44% (p=0.52); OS 88%, 75%, and 66% vs 83%, 69% and 59% (p=0.11) in the BEAM vs BUCYVP16 groups respectively (Figure 1). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was higher in the BEAM group (7 pts (2.6%) compared to none in BYCYVP16 (p<0.01)) but grade 3 or 4 mucositis was lower in BEAM (24.2%) compared to 56.1% in BUCYVP16 (p<0.01). There were no differences in hemorrhagic cystitis or second primary malignancy. Summary/Conclusions: This large retrospective study showed no statistical difference in PFS, OS, or CIR between BEAM and BUCVP16 conditioning regimens for AHSCT in relapsed NHL. Veno-occlusive disease occurred more frequently in the BEAM group, while grade 3 or 4 mucositis occurred more frequently in the BUCYVP16 group. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) dissemination of aggressive lymphoma is a rare and aggressive disorder which may present de novo with concomitant systemic disease or as CNS relapse (isolated or with systemic disease). The majority of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be cured with R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). The most common cause of treatment failure is systemic relapse or progression. However, CNS relapse occurs in 2-6% of all DLBCL patients and is associated with a poor survival of less than six months. Modern risk stratification includes several clinical and biological features. A validated clinical risk model employing the International Prognostic Index risk factors plus adrenal or renal involvement is able to identify a high-risk patient population with an increased risk for CNS recurrence > 10%. Nevertheless, there is little data to inform optimal delivery of CNS prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Recently, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) has increasingly been used in routine clinical practice due to the limited efficacy of intrathecal prophylaxis and the predominant parenchymal site of CNS manifestation. However, this approach is not supported by randomized data. Indication, timing and intensity of HD-MTX delivery differs largely and its efficacy has recently been challenged by results of a large Canadian retrospective study including > 900 patients showing that HD-MTX did not lower the risk of CNS dissemination in DLBCL. Once CNS dissemination has occurred, intensive CNS directed therapy appears to improve overall outcomes compared to systemic therapy alone. Recent data from the largest prospective trial focused on SCNSL patients support this approach by demonstrating durable remission after intensified chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab, cytarabine, thiotepa and rituximab (MATRix) and the non-cross resistant agents ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide with rituximab (R-ICE) followed by thiotepa-based highdose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Importantly, patients with CNS disease at initial diagnosis and patients with CNS dissemination during or after upfront R-CHOP treatment showed different outcomes. This presentation will highlight recent evidence regarding prophylaxis and treatment of CNS involvement of aggressive lymphoma and derive treatment approaches for this heterogeneous subgroup of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The incidence of mucositis caused by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is relatively high. The severe painful mucositis can reduce the quality of life of patients obviously. Transdermal fentanyl is efficient in treating chronic pain of cancer, and also can relieve the severe pain of mucositis resulted from chemotherapy. This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl for the severe painful mucositis caused by AHSCT. METHODS: A total of 22 malignant tumor patients suffered from severe mucositis caused by high dose chemotherapy combined AHSCT. The analgesic degree before and after treatment was evaluated by the scores of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (range 0-10). The median VAS scores of all patients were above 4 (moderate to severe pain) before the administration of transdermal fentanyl. The quality of life before and after treatment was evaluated by the Standard of Quality of Life drew up in China in 1990. The adverse events after treatment were evaluated by Common Toxicity Criteria formulated by National Cancer Institute of the USA. RESULTS: The median VAS score has been decreased from baseline at 6 (4-9) to 3.5 (0-9) on Day 3, 2 (0-6) on Day 5, 0.5 (0-8) on Day 7, 0 (0-6) on Day 10, and 0 (0-5) on Day 15 after treatment (P<0.001). The overall response rate was 100%, while the complete response rate was 45.5%. The quality of life of the patients was improved significantly (P<0.01). The adverse events after treatment of transdermal fentanyl included dizziness, somnolence, dysuria, mild and transient nausea, vomiting, discomfort of stomach, and so on. All the adverse events disappeared within several days after proper managements. Neither severe adverse event nor drug addiction was found. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal fentanyl has good analgesic effect on painful severe mucositis induced by AHSCT. It is convenient and well tolerated, and could improve quality of life significantly.

AB  - PURPOSE: High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with peripheral-blood progenitor cell (PBPC) and autologous bone marrow (ABM) transplant (T) has documented survival benefits for relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Treatment costs associated with HDC and its supportive care have restricted its use both on and off clinical trial. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT resulted in faster recovery of bone marrow function, with less hospitalization and supportive care than ABMT. This study was undertaken to analyze the costs of the two strategies using prospectively collected data from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical results and resource utilization from a randomized clinical trial that compared filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT versus ABMT following carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) HDC for HD and NHL are presented. The trial was performed in six centers in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Resource utilization data were used to project costs and Massay Cancer Center (MCC) in the United States incurred the cost of treating the cohort. Costs were projected to the United States, because the economic implications to United States centers are significant, costs of care vary markedly among countries but resource utilization on this trial did not, and a randomized trial is unlikely to be performed in the United States. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients with relapsed HD or NHL underwent HDC with BEAM. The PBPCT and ABMT groups had similar short-term survival after BEAM. PBPCT patients had a shorter hospitalization (median, 17 v 23 days; P = .002), neutrophil recovery (11 v 14 days; P = .005), platelet recovery to > or = 20 x 10(9)/L (16 v 23 days; P = .02), and days of platelet transfusions (6 v 10; P < .001). Estimated costs were $8,531 for ABM harvest and $5,760 for PBPC collection, including filgrastim mobilization. The total estimated average cost was $59,314 for each ABMT patient versus $45,792 for each PBPCT patient. Cost savings of $13,521 (23%) were due to shorter hospitalizations with less supportive care. CONCLUSION: PBPCT is as safe and more effective than ABMT for HD and NHL in the short term. PBPCT represents a significant cost savings due to lower autograft collection costs, shorter hospital stays, and less supportive care. The savings exceed the costs for filgrastim mobilization and PBPC collection. Actual savings will vary depending on local practice patterns, charges, and costs.

AB  - Combined direct antineoplastic activity and the long-lasting immunological effects of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure many hematological malignancies, but broad adoption requires non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) control. Recently, posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) given after a bone marrow transplant significantly reduced GVHD-incidence, while PTCy given with tacrolimus/mofetil mycophenolate (T/MMF) showed activity following allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPB-SCT). Here, we report the experience of a larger cohort (85 consecutive patients) and expanded follow-up period (03/2011-12/2019) with high-risk hematological malignancies who received alloPB-SCT from Human-Leukocyte-Antigens HLA-matched unrelated/related donors. GVHD-prophylaxis was PTCy 50 mg/kg (days+3 and +4) combined with T/MMF (day+5 forward). All patients stopped MMF on day+28 with day+110 = median tacrolimus discontinuation. Cumulative incidences were 12% for acute and 7% for chronic GVHD-and no GVHD-attributed deaths. For surviving patients, the 12, 24, and 36-month probabilities of being off immunosuppression were 92, 96, and 96%, respectively. After a 36-month median follow-up, NRM was 4%; median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) had yet to occur. One-and two-year chronic GVHD-EFS results were 57% (95% CI, 46-68%) and 53% (95% CI, 45-61%), respectively, with limited late infections and long-term organ toxicities. Disease relapse caused the most treatment failures (38% at 2 years), but low transplant toxicity allowed many patients (14/37, 38%) to receive donor lymphocyte infusions as a post-relapse strategy. We confirmed that PTCy+T/MMF treatment effectively prevented acute and chronic GVHD and limited NRM to unprecedented low rates without loss of disease control efficacy in an expanded patient cohort.

AB  - Most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) experience multiple relapses necessitating subsequent lines of therapy. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies, showed promising activity in FL in a phase 1 study. We report the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating ibrutinib in recurrent FL. Forty patients with recurrent FL were treated with ibrutinib 560 mg/d until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Exploratory analyses included correlations of outcome with recurrent mutations identified in a cancer gene panel that used next-generation sequencing in pretreatment biopsies from 31 patients and results of early interim positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans in 20 patients. ORR was 37.5% with a complete response rate of 12.5%, median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14 months, and 2-year PFS of 20.4%. Response rates were significantly higher among patients whose disease was sensitive to rituximab (52.6%) compared with those who were rituximab refractory (16.7%) (P = .04). CARD11 mutations were present in 16% of patients (5 of 31) and predicted resistance to ibrutinib with only wild-type patients responding (P = .002). Maximum standardized uptake value at cycle 1 day 8 correlated with response and PFS. Ibrutinib was well-tolerated with a toxicity profile similar to labeled indications. Ibrutinib is a well-tolerated treatment with modest activity in relapsed FL. Evaluation of BTK inhibitors in earlier lines of therapy may be warranted on the basis of improved response rates in rituximab-sensitive disease. Somatic mutations such as CARD11 may have an impact on response to ibrutinib, may inform clinical decisions, and should be evaluated in larger data sets. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01849263.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pixantrone dimaleate (pixantrone)--a novel aza-anthracenedione--was synthesised to reduce anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity without compromising antitumour efficacy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pixantrone versus an investigator's choice of a single-agent therapy in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial at 66 hospitals in Europe, India, Russia, South America, the UK, and the USA, patients with histologically confirmed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed after two or more previous chemotherapy regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice response system to treatment with pixantrone dimaleate (85 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, for up to six cycles) or to a comparator (vinorelbine, oxaliplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mitoxantrone, or gemcitabine) given at prespecified standard doses and schedules. Patients were stratified by region, International Prognostic Index score, and previous stem-cell transplantation. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment; however, an independent assessment panel was masked. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete or unconfirmed complete response in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population at the end of treatment. Primary analyses of efficacy were based on the independent assessment panel's data review. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00088530. FINDINGS: The ITT population comprised 70 patients randomly assigned to the pixantrone group and 70 to the comparator. Five patients (two in the pixantrone group and three in the comparator group) dropped out before receiving their study drug. 14 patients (20·0% [95% CI 11·4-31·3]) who received pixantrone achieved a complete or unconfirmed complete response at end of treatment compared with four patients (5·7% [1·6-14·0]) in the comparator group (p = 0·021). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients given pixantrone were uncomplicated, non-cumulative neutropenia (28 [41·2%] of 68 patients vs 13 [19·4%] of 67 patients in the comparator group), leucopenia (16 [23·5%] vs five [7·5%]), and thrombocytopenia (eight [11·8%] vs seven [10·4%]). INTERPRETATION: Pixantrone, given as a single-agent salvage therapy in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is efficacious and tolerable. It could be a treatment option for patients whose aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma has failed to respond to at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. FUNDING: Cell Therapeutics, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Despite frequent long lasting remissions to first-line treatment, follicular lymphoma of advanced stages is characterized by recurrent relapses. In the randomized PRIMA trial of the GELA, rituximab maintenance achieved prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation in remission after first-line immunochemotherapy (Salles et al., Lancet 2011). The German study groups GLSG and OSHO initiated in 2007 a double randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance versus observation in remission after randomly assigned induction treatment. Method(s): Previously untreated patients with Ann Arbor stage II-IV follicular lymphoma in need of therapy and not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation or curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP, R-MCP, or RFCM. Patients responding to induction treatment were subsequently randomised to 2 years rituximab maintenance or observation, stratified by type of induction treatment, quality of remission, and FLIPI. The trial was initially planned to detect with 95% power a 15% difference in complete remission rates between any of the three induction groups and a PFS hazard ratio of 0.60 by postremission strategy. Result(s): Recruitment was stopped in 2011 after the PRIMA results had been published. Median age of the 206 recruited patients was 66 years (range, 24-86), and FLIPI was low in 13%, intermediate in 28%, and high in 60%. A trend towards higher complete remission rates with R-FCM (43% of 58 patients) compared to R-CHOP (23% of 66) and R-MCP (24% of 66) was observed, but the differences were not statistically significant. High and comparable overall response rates were observed after R-CHOP (88%), R-MCP (89%), and R-FCM (91%). In terms of grade 3-4 leukocytopenia and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, R-FCM (92%, 17%) was more toxic than R-MCP (88%, 6%) which was more toxic than R-CHOP (63%, 3%); R-CHOP showed more frequent neurological toxicities (40%) compared with R-MCP (14%) and R-FCM (16%). Rituximab maintenance substantially prolonged progression-free survival in comparison to observation in remission (hazard ratio 0.39, p = 0.0064). In the rituximab maintenance group, 3-years PFS was 89% (8 PFS events among 65 patients) compared with 69% in the observation group (19 events among 63 patients). With 11 events, no differences in overall survival could be observed for maintenance vs. observation (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.32-3.43, p = 0.95). Rituximab maintenance was more toxic with regards to leukocytes and the gastro-intestinal tract. Conclusion(s): In this randomized trial, 2 years rituximab maintenance was associated with substantially prolonged PFS in comparison to observation after response to first-line immunochemotherapy in follicular lymphoma. Our data represent an independent confirmation of the GELA PRIMA trial results.

AB  - Background: Benefits of cord blood transplantation include low rates of relapse and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the use of cord blood is rapidly declining because of the high incidence of infections, severe acute GVHD, and transplant-related mortality. UM171, a haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal agonist, has been shown to expand cord blood stem cells and enhance multilineage blood cell reconstitution in mice. We aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation in patients with haematological malignancies who do not have a suitable HLA-matched donor. Method(s): This single-arm, open-label, phase 1-2 safety and feasibility study was done at two hospitals in Canada. The study had two parts. In part 1, patients received two cord blood units (one expanded with UM171 and one unmanipulated cord blood) until UM171-expanded cord blood demonstrated engraftment. Once engraftment was documented we initiated part 2, reported here, in which patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood unit with a dose de-escalation design to determine the minimal cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. Eligible patients were aged 3-64 years, weighed 12 kg or more, had a haematological malignancy with an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and did not have a suitable HLA-matched donor, and a had a Karnofsky performance status score of 70% or more. Five clinical sites were planned to participate in the study; however, only two study sites opened, both of which only treated adult patients, thus no paediatric patients (aged <18 years) were recruited. Patients aged younger than 50 years without comorbidities received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, fludarabine 75 mg/m2, and 12 Gy total body irradiation) and patients aged older than 50 years and those with comorbidities received a less myeloablative conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m2, and 4 Gy total body irradiation). Patients were infused with the 7-day UM171-expanded CD34-positive cells and the lymphocyte-containing CD34-negative fraction. The primary endpoints were feasibility of UM171 expansion, safety of the transplant, kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution (time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment) of UM171-expanded cord blood, and minimal pre-expansion cord blood unit cell dose that achieved prompt engraftment. We analysed feasibility in all enrolled patients and all other primary outcomes were analysed per protocol, in all patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. This trial has been completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02668315. Finding(s): Between Feb 17, 2016, and Nov 11, 2018, we enrolled 27 patients, four of whom received two cord blood units for safety purposes in part 1 of the study. 23 patients were subsequently enrolled in part 2 to receive a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplant and 22 patients received a single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation. At data cutoff (Dec 31, 2018), median follow-up was 18 months (IQR 12-22). The minimal cord blood unit cell dose at thaw that achieved prompt engraftment as a single cord transplant after UM171 expansion was 0.52 x 105 CD34-positive cells. We successfully expanded 26 (96%) of 27 cord blood units with UM171. Among the 22 patients who received single UM171-expanded cord blood transplantation, median time to engraftment of 100 neutrophils per muL was 9.5 days (IQR 8-12), median time to engraftment of 500 neutrophils per muL was 18 days (12.5-20.0), and no graft failure occurred. Median time to platelet recovery was 42 days (IQR 35-47). The most common non-haematological adverse events were grade 3 febrile neutropenia (16 [73%] of 22 patients) and bacteraemia (nine [41%]). No unexpected adverse events were observed. One (5%) of 22 patients died due to treatment-related diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Interpretation(s): Our preliminary findings suggest that UM171 cord blood stem cell expansion is feasible, safe, and allows for the use of small single cords without compromising engraftment. UM171-expanded cord blood might have the potential to overcome the disadvantages of other cord blood transplants while maintaining the benefits of low risk of chronic GVHD and relapse, and warrants further investigation in randomised trials.

AB  - In a blinded retrospective economic evaluation of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial, total utilisation and charges for lymphoid cancer patients who received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) or placebo were compared following autologous bone marrow transplantation. The 40 patients enrolled (22 rhGM-CSF, 18 placebo) could have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease, be of any age, and were undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation in a metropolitan cancer research centre. Main outcome measures consisted of initial hospital lengths of stay (LOS), total and department charges, rehospitalisation rates and charges, and outpatient charges, all inclusive of the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion. The perspective of the study is that of the third party payer. Initial hospitalisation charges were $US54 100 for patients who received rhGM-CSF and $US68 600 for patients who received placebo (p = 0.05). The difference of $US14 500 was 21% less in patients who received rhGM-CSF, mainly due to lower average LOS with rhGM-CSF (24.2 days) compared with placebo (30.8 days). Outpatient charges were $US9500 (rhGM-CSF) and $US6800 (placebo) {p = 0.18}. Total charges, including readmission (10 per group) were $US12 200 lower in the rhGM-CSF group ($US70 300 vs $US82 500, p = 0.19). The use of rhGM-CSF after autologous bone marrow transplantation was shown to result in substantial cost savings during the initial hospitalisation. When comparing total inpatient and outpatient medical charges within the first 100 days following bone marrow infusion, we found no evidence that these savings were negated.

AB  - Background. Autologous transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) results in faster haematopoietic-cell repopulation than with bone marrow. We prospectively compared bone marrow and PBSC for allogeneic transplantation. Methods. Adult HLA-identical sibling donors provided bone marrow and lenograstim-mobilised PBSC. 39 patients with malignant haematological disorders were infused with either bone marrow (n = 19) or PBSC (n = 20) after standard conditioning regimens in a double-blind, randomised fashion. The identity of the infused products for all patients remained masked until 1 year after the last patient had received transplantation. Findings. The PBSC group had significantly faster neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 109/L (median 17.5 vs 23 days, p = 0.002), and platelet recovery to 20 x 109/L (median 11 vs 18 days, p < 0.0001) and to 50 x 109/L (median 20.5 vs 27 days, p = 0.02) than the bone-marrow group. PBS0 patients were discharged from hospital earlier than were bone-marrow patients (median 26 vs 31 days, p = 0.01). At 4 weeks after transplantation, absolute lymphocytes (0.48 vs 0.63, p = 0.08) and CD25 cells (0.04 vs 0.08, p = 0.007) were higher in the PBSC group, and the proportion of patients with absolute lymphopenia (74% vs 33%, p = 0.03) and CD4 lymphopenia (59% vs 24%, p = 0.05) was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of acute or chronic graft-versus host disease and overall survival. The probability of relapse was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group than in the PBSC group (p = 0.01); all five relapses occurred among bone-marrow recipients. Interpretation. Our small study indicates that PBSCs are better than bone marrow for allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical siblings in terms of faster haematopoietic and immune recovery, and have the potential to reduce disease recurrence.

AB  - This trial is designed as an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, treatment optimisation study, preceded by safety run-in phases conducted for B-cell and T-cell lymphoma separately. Aim of the phase-III trial is to test whether prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodg-kin Lymphoma not eligible for neither autologous nor alloge-neic stem cell transplantation can be improved by combining nivolumab with (R)-GemOx. Population: All patients with frst relapse or progression of an aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma aged older than 65 years or older than 18 years with HCT-CI score > 2 are eligible for this study irrespective of their gender or stage of disease. Tere is no upper limit of age. Also patients not eligible for neither autologous nor allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible for this study. Primary objective: Improvement of 1-yr PFS by nivolumab plus (R)-GemOx followed by nivolumab consolidation instead of (R)-GemOx alone. Primary endpoint is 1-yrs progression-free survival.

AB  - Background: Initial results from the ongoing GALLIUM trial have shown that patients with follicular lymphoma have a longer progression-free survival after first-line immunochemotherapy with obinutuzumab than with rituximab. The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the prognostic value of PET-CT responses after first-line immunochemotherapy in the GALLIUM study. Method(s): GALLIUM is an open-label, parallel-group randomised, phase 3 trial, which recruited previously untreated patients with CD20-positive follicular lymphoma (grades 1-3a; disease stage III/IV, or stage II with largest tumour diameter >=7 cm) who were aged 18 years or older and met the criteria for needing treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous administration of obinutuzumab (1000 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of subsequent cycles) or rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle), in six 21-day cycles with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (known as CHOP; oral administration) followed by two 21-day cycles of antibody alone, or eight 21-day cycles cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (known as CVP; oral administration), or six 28-day cycles with bendamustine, followed by maintenance antibody every 2 months for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint of the trial, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, has been reported previously. This secondary analysis reports PET and CT-based responses at end-of-induction therapy and explains their relation with progression-free and overall survival outcomes in patients with available scans. As per protocol, during the trial, PET scans (mandatory in the first 170 patients enrolled at sites with available PET facilities, and optional thereafter), acquired at baseline and end of induction (PET population), were assessed prospectively by investigators and an independent review committee (IRC) applying International Harmonisation Project (IHP) 2007 response criteria, and retrospectively by the IRC only applying current Lugano 2014 response criteria. IRC members (but not study investigators) were masked to treatment and clinical outcome when assessing response. The landmark analyses excluded patients who died or progressed (contrast enhanced CT-based assessment of progressive disease, or started next anti-lymphoma treatment) before or at end of induction. GALLIUM is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01332968. Finding(s): 1202 patients were enrolled in GALLIUM between July 6, 2011, and Feb 4, 2014, of whom 595 were included in the PET population; 533 (IHP 2007; prospective analysis), and 508 (Lugano 2014; retrospective analysis) were analysed for progression-free survival (landmark analysis). At end of induction, 390 of 595 patients (65.5% [95% CI 61.6-69.4]) achieved PET complete response according to IHP 2007 criteria, and 450 (75.6% [95% CI 72.0-79.0]) obtained PET complete metabolic response according to Lugano 2014 criteria. With a median of 43.3 months of observation (IQR 36.2-51.8), 2.5-year progression-free survival from end of induction was 87.8% (95% CI 83.9-90.8) in PET complete responders and 72.0% (63.1-79.0) in non-complete responders according to IRC-assessed IHP 2007 criteria (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6, p<0.0001). According to Lugano 2014 criteria, 2.5-year progression-free survival in complete metabolic responders was 87.4% (95% CI 83.7-90.2) and in non-complete metabolic responders was 54.9% (40.5-67.3; HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.3, p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Our results suggest that PET is a better imaging modality than contrast-enhanced CT for response assessment after first-line immunochemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma. PET assessment according to Lugano 2014 response criteria provides a platform for investigation of response-adapted therapeutic approaches. Additional supportive data are welcomed.

AB  - The cost-effectiveness of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) compared with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Morbus Hodgkin (MH) was assessed. Costs were determined from the induction chemotherapy regimen up to 3 months after discharge from hospital following the transplantation. Quality of life was measured by the EuroQol, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and the SF-36. Patients were randomised according to a 2:1 ratio to undergo either PBSCT or ABMT. 62 patients underwent PBSCT and 29 ABMT. Costs of the transplantation period were significantly lower in the PBSCT group (15008 Euros) than in the ABMT group (19000 Euros). Significant differences in quality of life were all in favour of PBSCT and emerged using the RSCL, both on 14 days after the transplantation and three months after discharge. We conclude that PBSCT is associated with lower costs and a better quality of life than ABMT for patients with refractory or relapsed NHL or MH.

AB  - Background: Fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab is frequently used in patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas who relapse after alkylating chemotherapy. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rituximab with bendamustine or fludarabine in patients with relapsed, indolent, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mantle-cell lymphoma. Method(s): For this randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 55 centres in Germany, who were subsequently randomised centrally according to prespecified randomisation lists with permuted blocks of randomly variable block size to rituximab (375 mg/m2, day 1) plus either bendamustine (90 mg/m2, days 1 and 2) or fludarabine (25 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 28 days for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Patients were aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 0-2 and had relapsed or refractory indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma; patients refractory to regimens that included rituximab, bendamustine, or purine analogue drugs were excluded. Patients were stratified by histological subtypes of lymphoma and by their latest previous therapies. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and the final analysis was completed per protocol. Non-inferiority of bendamustine plus rituximab versus fludarabine plus rituximab was defined as a difference of less than 15% in 1-year progression-free survival. The protocol was amended in July, 2006, after approval of rituximab maintenance (375 mg/m2 every 3 months for up to 2 years), which was then given to patients achieving a response to either trial treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01456351 (closed to enrolment, follow-up is ongoing). Finding(s): Between Oct 8, 2003, and Aug 5, 2010, we randomly assigned 230 patients to treatment groups (116 bendamustine plus rituximab, 114 fludarabine plus rituximab). 11 patients were excluded for protocol violations and were not followed up further (two in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and nine in the fludarabine plus rituximab group). Thus, 219 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis (114 bendamustine plus rituximab, 105 fludarabine plus rituximab). 1-year progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.84) and 0.48 (0.39-0.58) with fludarabine plus rituximab (non-inferiority p<0.0001). At a median follow-up of 96 months (IQR 73.2-112.9), median progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 34.2 months (95% CI 23.5-52.7) and 11.7 months (8.0-16.1) with fludarabine plus rituximab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54 [95% CI 0.38-0.72], log-rank test p<0.0001). Safety outcomes were similar in both groups, with 46 serious adverse events recorded (23 in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and 23 in the fludarabine plus rituximab group), most commonly myelosuppression and infections. Interpretation(s): In combination with rituximab, bendamustine was more effective than fludarabine, suggesting that bendamustine plus rituximab may be the preferred treatment option for patients with relapsed indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas.
