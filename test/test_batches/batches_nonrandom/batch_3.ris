AB  - Karl S Peggs and Sarah J Albon contributed equally to the work and are joint first author Introduction Alemtuzumab reduces the incidence of GVHD after unrelated donor stem cell transplant (MUD SCT) but delays immune reconstitution resulting in high morbidity/mortality from viral infections. Previous studies have suggested that adoptive transfer of allodepleted donor T cells (ADTs) improves immunity after SCT but this has never been tested in a randomised study. We developed a methodology for selective immunomagnetic depletion of alloreactive T-cells upregulating CD25 and CD71 after activation with host dendritic cells (DC) and showed that ADTs retain anti-viral responses with minimal host alloreactivity (Samarasinghe et al Blood 2010). We have now tested whether ADTs can safely be used to improve immune reconstitution after MUD SCT for haematological malignancies in a randomised Phase II multi-centre clinical study; ICAT (NCT01827579). Methods Patients undergoing Alemtuzumab-based peripheral blood SCT from a 9/10 or 10/10 MUD for haematological malignancy were randomised 2:1 to receive either the ATIMP (ADTs) or standard of care. Two weeks prior to SCT, patients randomised to ATIMP underwent a leucapheresis from which DCs were generated. Irradiated patient-derived DCs were then co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from an unstimulated leucapheresis/500ml blood draw from the donor to activate alloreactive T cells. Four days later, the co-culture was depleted of CD25+ and CD71+ fractions by immunomagnetic depletion on the CliniMACs, sampled for residual alloreactivity and sterility, and cryopreserved. Patients randomised to the ATIMP were scheduled to receive 3 escalating doses of ADTs (0.1x106/Kg at day 30, 0.3x106/Kg at day 60 and 1x106/Kg at day 90 post-SCT) until either there was >grade 1 aGVHD or they had normal circulating T cells (>700/microL). The primary end-point of the study was circulating CD3+ T cell count at 4 months post-SCT with one-sided 15% significance level. Acute/chronic GVHD were graded using the Seattle/NIH criteria respectively. Results Twenty one patients were treated, 13 on the ATIMP arm and 8 on the control arm. The median age was 53 years and 67% (14) were male. 12 were AML/Myelodysplasia, 5 NHL, 3 CLL/CML and 1 HL. The median follow-up time is 14 months. Five of 13 ATIMP patients received 1 dose of ADTs, 4/13 2 doses and 4/13 all 3 doses. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was comparable between the arms. Overall, 7/13 ATIMP patients developed significant (>Grade 2) acute GVHD compared to 4/8 of the control arm (p>0.99). 3/13 patients in the ATIMP arm and 2/8 patients in the control arm developed severe aGVHD (all Grade 3). Three of 13 ATIMP cohort patients developed chronic GVHD (1 mild, 1 moderate, 1 severe), compared to 3/8 (all mild) in the control cohort. At 4 months, the circulating CD3+ T cell count mean was 730/microL (range 10-4080) in the ATIMP group and 212.5/microL (range 10-500) in the control group (1-sided p=0.11). However, the data was not normally distributed (Wilcoxon 1-sided p=0.18). Three ATIMP patients had high CD3+ T cell count at 4 months (>1000/microL). At 6 months, the mean circulating CD3+ T cell count was 833.6/microL (range 20-2690) and 327.5/microL (range 10-860). At month 4, the mean PHA stimulation index in the ATIMP arm was 16.8 (range 0.67- 73.1) vs 3.8 (range 1.1-8.2) in the control group. At 4 and 6 months post-SCT, spectratyping analysis showed no evidence of a difference in Vbeta diversity between the 2 arms in both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The 1-year survival rate in the ATIMP cohort is 92% vs 88% in the control, and 1-year disease free survival rate 67% in the ATIMP cohort vs 70% in the control. Conclusions These data suggest that adoptive transfer of ADTs improves T cell reconstitution in some patients after MUD SCT and that the GVHD rates were similar between ATIMP and control groups.

AB  - Background CD20 is a cell surface antigen commonly expressed on B-cell lineage, but is absent on hematopoietic stem cells and plasma cells. Therefore, it has been postulated that its targeting should not significantly affect immunoglobulin serum concentrations. However, due to rapid and prolonged B-cell depletion, rituximab-based therapy has been shown to impair humoral response. In addition, protective serologic response to influenza vaccination in lymphoma patients in the 6 months following rituximab-containing regimen has been found to be particularly low1. Because the vast majority of adults individuals have been previously vaccinated against tetanus, we decided to analyse the impact of prolonged rituximab-based therapy on the immune protection rate against tetanus toxin in patients, and conducted in this aim a sub-analysis in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients treated into the PRIMA study Methods The PRIMA study is a multicentre, phase III, randomized study in patients with advanced FL evaluating the benefit of maintenance therapy with rituximab after induction of response with chemotherapy plus rituximab in comparison with no maintenance therapy, whose results have been previously published2. In a subset of patients, serum samples were prospectively collected and antitetanus toxin antibodies were measured at baseline, end of immunochemotherapy induction and end of maintenance period. Protective titer was defined as > 0.1 UI/mL according to standards. Statistical analysis aimed to determine if serum antitetanus antibodies titers significantly changed over time according to different phases of treatment, and if rituximab maintenance arm had a significant impact as compared to observation arm Results Overall, 104 patients were evaluable for this subanalysis. Fifty-five percent were male. Median age was 57 (range, 27-80), 88.5% had Ann-Arbor stage III-IV disease. All patients had received R-CHOP induction. Among those patients, 56 were randomised into rituximab arm, 48 into observation arm. At baseline, median serum antitetanus antibodies titers in the overall population was 0.8 UI/mL (range, 0-8) and 89.4% of patients had protective titers. At the end of induction, among the 70 evaluable subjects, 90% had still a protective titer with a median of 0.7 UI/mL (range, 0-4), and at the end of maintenance period, among the 62 evaluable patients, 93% had still protective titer with a median of 0.8 (range, 0-3). When comparing the two arms, at the end of maintenance period, median serum antitetanus antibodies titer was 0.8 UI/mL in the rituximab arm, not significantly different from that in the observation arm (0.6 UI/mL) (p=0.17). At the end of the maintenance period, 100% of subjects had still protective titer in the rituximab arm versus 84.6% in the observation arm Conclusion In this subanalysis of 104 FL treated patients issued from the PRIMA study, rituximab-based induction and maintenance therapy did not significantly affect the immunisation rate against tetanus toxin in previously immunized patients. These results are in contrast with the poor serologic response rate obtained following rituximab-based therapy, emphasizing that common serum vaccinal titers should be controlled, and vaccination updated, when possible, before treatment initiation and the first rituximab administration.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine in a randomised trial whether there is any significant difference in toxicity between modified CHOP and MCOP chemotherapy in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and to determine whether this reduced dose chemotherapy can be administered with full dose intensity, low toxicity and produce acceptable survival. Patients and Methods: Between 1993 and 2000, 155 eligible patients were randomised into this trial mainly from three centres (Nottingham, Birmingham and Leeds, UK). The patients were newly diagnosed with aggressive NHL and had a median age of 74 years (range 65-91 years). Ninety-six patients (62%) had bulky stage I or II disease; 59 patients (38%) had either stage III or IV disease; 77% had one or more extranodal sites involved at presentation; and 31% showed B symptoms. Seventy-seven patients were randomised to receive six cycles of modified CHOP (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 i.v., doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 i.v., vincristine 1 mg i.v. all on day 1 with prednisolone 20 mg bd for days 1-5) every 21 days and 78 patients to MCOP (mitozantrone 10 mg/m2 i.v. substituted for doxorubicin). Growth factors were not used routinely. After completion of chemotherapy, 39 patients received involved field radiotherapy (35-40 Gy) in 20 fractions. Result(s): One hundred and one patients (65%) completed all six cycles of chemotherapy. The median course dose intensity was 97%. The median follow-up for 53 surviving patients was 51 months. The median survival was 19 months (95% confidence interval 10-36 months) with an actuarial survival of 47% at 2 years and 42% at 3 years (CHOP versus MCOP, P = 0.79). There was no significant difference in any of the toxicities experienced with either CHOP or MCOP, except for white cell count (46 patients on MCOP and 27 patients on CHOP had grade 3 or 4 toxicity, P = 0.002) and red cell transfusion (37 patients, MCOP; 17 patients, CHOP; P = 0.001). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was documented in 75 patients (50%). One patient died from toxicity whilst in remission and seven patients died with septicaemia and persistent NHL. Conclusion(s): This multicentre randomised trial provides further information on the dose intensity achievable with CHOP or MCOP regimens in elderly patients (median age 74 years) with aggressive NHL. These dose-reduced regimens can be given with nearly 100% dose intensity with 65% of patients completing all the treatment. Survival is comparable to that observed with the more intensive regimens given in this age group.

AB  - PIX306 was a phase 3, randomised, single-blind, multicentre trial conducted in adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3 who relapsed after >=1 rituximab-containing regimen and were not eligible for a stem cell transplant. Patients were randomised 1:1 to pixantrone 50 mg/m2 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, combined with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, for up to six cycles. Patients were followed for up to 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), complete response (CR) rate, overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Overall, 312 patients were randomised (median age 73.0 years). The study did not meet its primary endpoint. Median PFS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 7.3 months (5.2-8.4) with pixantrone + rituximab (PIX + R) and 6.3 months (4.4-8.1) with gemcitabine + rituximab [GEM + R; hazard ratio (HR): 0.85; 95% CI 0.64-1.14; P = 0.28]. Median OS was 13.3 (10.1-19.8) months with PIX + R and 19.6 (12.4-31.9) months with GEM + R (HR: 1.13; 95% CI 0.83-1.53). ORR was 61.9% and 43.9% respectively and CR rate 35.5% and 21.7%. The incidence of adverse events, including cardiac events, was not statistically significant different between PIX + R and GEM + R.Copyright © 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a distinct sub-group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas which the Working Formulation categorises as high grade malignancy. It is characterised at diagnosis by frequent mediastinal involvement. However, bone marrow and subsequent peripheral blood involvement are common. From a histologic and cytologic point of view it is identical to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Sequential chemotherapy has improved the prognosis of this lymphoma in terms of survival and disease free survival (DFS). However, there are a series of negative prognostic factors present at diagnosis which seem to reduce survival and DFS due to the high risk of relapse. For this reason, small groups of patients in complete remission were treated with high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) after conventional chemotherapy. An international randomised study is at present underway to determine the usefulness of ABMT for patients responding to front line therapy.

AB  - In this second part of the review the clinical significance of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) as treatment for acute leukemias (AL) and malignant lymphomas is described. In most adult patients with AL in complete remission treated with conventional maintenance therapy relapse usually occurs within one year. However, the results of ABMT, as an intensive consolidation treatment in patients with AL in remission show long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of 40% of patients. Even better results have been reported in patients with purged bone marrow, although the difference is not statistically significant. A major problem of ABMT is still the high percentage of relapse (50%), while the probability of treatment related mortality is relatively low (up to 10%). ABMT is also showing good results in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of intermediate and high-grade histology and in Hodgkin's disease in cases refractory to the first line therapy and in sensitive relapse. However, in refractory cases the results are poor. It is noteworthy, that in all disorders treated with ABMT, prospective randomised controlled trials are missing and current data are based on heterogenous groups of patients. In the majority of solid tumors, even escalated doses of radiochemotherapy with ABMT are not able to eradicate malignant disease. In contrast, the results are very good in neuroblastoma. Although ABMT is a relatively complex and aggressive method, it is being increasingly applied to the treatment of haematological malignant diseases and the results obtained so far, are encouraging and showing that ABMT, besides allogeneic BMT, represents a promising potentially curative treatment for selected group of patients.

AB  - Background: Polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting the CD79b component of the B-cell receptor, has demonstrated activity as a single agent and in combination with rituximab in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this study, we evaluated the safety and preliminary activity of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Method(s): This was an open-label, non-randomised study composed of a phase 1b dose escalation and a phase 2 dose expansion at 11 hospitals and health centres in the USA and France. Patients aged 18 years or older with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were eligible. Exclusion criteria included peripheral neuropathy with grade greater than 1, major surgery within 4 weeks before enrolment, known CNS involvement of lymphoma, and uncontrolled heart disease. Phase 1b dose escalation had a three-plus-three design and established the recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 expansion evaluated the recommended phase 2 dose of polatuzumab vedotin in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with an International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2-5. Patients received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 intravenously, and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle orally (CHP), plus either rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of each cycle (R-CHP) or obinutuzumab 1000 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of the following cycles (G-CHP). Polatuzumab vedotin was administered on day 2 of cycles 1 and 2, and on day 1 of the following cycles at 1.0-2.4 mg/kg during the escalation phase and at the recommended phase 2 dose during the expansion phase. Treatment could last six or eight cycles, depending on investigator preference. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and tolerability, and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (or recommended phase 2 dose) of polatuzumab vedotin. All endpoints were analysed per protocol in the safety evaluable population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992653. Finding(s): Between Dec 4, 2013, and July 26, 2016, 85 patients were enrolled. 82 patients were included in the safety and activity evaluable populations, 25 in phase 1b and 57 in phase 2. In light of information from other studies using polatuzumab vedotin reported during this study, in which the safety profile associated with exposure to polatuzumab vedotin at doses higher than 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks was not outweighed by any clinical benefit, the recommended phase 2 dose was set to 1.8 mg/kg in the R-CHP cohort and no higher doses were explored in this study. 66 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received the polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose (45 R-CHP; 21 G-CHP). In 66 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2 dose, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (20 [30%]), febrile neutropenia (12 [18%]), and thrombocytopenia (six [9%]). Among the 70 patients (any histology) who received the recommended phase 2 dose, 19 (27%) had grade 1 peripheral neuropathy, eight (11%) grade 2, and two (3%) grade 3. Four deaths were reported during follow-up: two treatment-related (one complication of atrial fibrillation and one septic shock) and two due to disease progression. As of the cutoff date of Dec 29, 2017, median follow-up time was 21.5 months (IQR 16.7-24.3) for the untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort treated at the polatuzumab vedotin recommended phase 2 dose. 59 (89%) patients achieved an overall response at end of treatment (51 [77%] patients had a complete response, and eight [12%] patients had a partial response). Interpretation(s): The safety of incorporating polatuzumab vedotin to R-CHP or G-CHP was as expected and managable. Preliminary clinical activity in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma seems promising and encouraged a phase 3 trial comparing polatuzumab vedotin with R-CHP to R-CHOP.

AB  - Background: Over 12,000 new cases of B-cell malignancies are diagnosed in the UK each year, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) being the most common subtypes. Standard frontline therapy consists of immunochemotherapy with a CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), such as rituximab, delivered in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Despite being considered a treatable and potentially curable cancer, approximately 30% of DLBCL cases will relapse after frontline therapy. Advanced stage FL is incurable and typically has a relapsing and remitting course with a frequent need for re-treatment. Based on supportive preclinical data, we hypothesised that the addition of varlilumab (an anti-CD27 mAb) to rituximab (an anti-CD20 mAb) can improve the rate, depth and duration of the response of rituximab monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Methods/design: Combination treatment of varlilumab plus rituximab, in two different dosing regimens, is being tested in the RIVA trial. RIVA is a two-stage open-label randomised phase IIa design in up to 40 patients with low- or high-grade relapsed or refractory CD20+ B-cell lymphoma. The study is open to recruitment in the UK. Enrolled patients are randomised 1:1 to two different experimental varlilumab to rituximab combinations. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination and the anti-tumour activity (response) in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Secondary objectives will include an evaluation of the duration of the response and overall survival. Tertiary translational objectives include assessment of B-cell depletion, changes in immune effector cell populations, expression of CD27 as a biomarker of response and pharmacokinetic properties. Analyses will not be powered for formal statistical comparisons between treatment arms. Discussion(s): RIVA will determine whether the combination of rituximab and varlilumab in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies is active and safe prior to future phase II/III trials.

AB  - Despite the greater risk of adverse COVID‐19 outcomes, antibody and cell‐mediated immune responses to COVID‐19 vaccines vary amongst immunocompromised (IC) people and are poorly defined. IC hosts were largely excluded from the COVID‐19 vaccine registration trials, though many countries recommend additional and booster doses of vaccination in this group. However, data are heterogeneous, in part due the variable nature of immunodeficiencies in IC groups and non‐standardised outcome measures used in studies. BOOST‐IC is an adaptive randomised clinical trial (RCT) to assess the immunogenicity and safety of additional COVID‐19 vaccine doses in immunocompromised (IC) people, including people with HIV, solid organ transplants (SOT) recipients or those with haematological malignancies. Briefly, the study aims to generate high‐quality evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of alternative COVID‐19 booster strategies against SARS‐CoV‐2 for IC people in Australia. To do this, participants who have previously completed 3‐ to 5‐doses of Australian TGA approved COVID‐19 vaccine (mRNA, ChAdOx‐1, Novavax) will be randomised 1:1:1 to one of 3 arms of vaccine boosting, namely: (i) single dose Pfizer, (ii) single dose Moderna or (iii) single dose Novavax. Participants who have undetectable anti‐spike SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies after 28 days (i.e. seronegative) will be secondarily randomised to an additional booster dose of COVID‐19 vaccine. Patients will be followed up for 455 days post randomisation. Specific study questions pertain to: ‐ examining how additional doses of COVID‐19 vaccine/s affect correlates of protective immunity ‐ examining the safety of additional doses of COVID‐19 vaccine/s ‐ characterising the humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID‐19 vaccination receiving 1 or 2 booster doses of COVID‐19 vaccine/s     ZM  - svm     ZS  - 2.3694698766801263     ZT  - sensitive     ZC  - 0.0691768267655864     ZR  - True     ZP  - -1

AB  - Mosunetuzumab (M), a CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody, has demonstrated high and consistent response rates in high-risk relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) patients (pts), with early evidence of a favourable benefit/risk profile. Lenalidomide (Len) is clinically active in FL pts. M + Len offers potentially additive/ synergistic efficacy via potent immunomodulatory activity. We present data from an ongoing Phase Ib study (NCT04246086) evaluating safety and activity of M + Len in R/R FL pts. Pts with R/R FL (Grade [Gr] 1-3a) and >=1 prior systemic anti-cancer therapy were enrolled to receive 12 cycles of M + Len (Cycle [C]1 duration: 21 days; C2-12: 28 days). In C1, step-up doses of M (intravenous [IV] infusion) were given on Day (D)1 (1 mg), and D8 (2mg), with the target dose (30 mg) given on C1D15 and on D1 of C2-12. Len (20 mg) was administered orally on D1-21 of C2-12. No hospitalisation was mandated. Primary objective: to evaluate M + Len safety. Secondary objective: to assess response and long-term efficacy outcomes. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria, responses were assessed with PET-CT using standard criteria. At data cut-off (31 May 2021) 27 pts were enrolled. The median age was 59 years (range: 31-79 years), 12 pts (44%) were male and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (18 pts, 67%) or 1 (9 pts, 33%). The median number of prior therapy lines was 1 (1-4); three pts (11%) had disease progression (PD) <24 months (m) from the start of first-line therapy. Sixteen pts (59%) had been on study for 0-3 m, 8 (30%) for 3-6 m, 2 (7%) for 6-9 m and 1 for >9 m. Twenty pts (74%) experienced >=1 adverse event (AE) of any Gr. The most common AE was CRS (8 pts, 30%). Gr3-4 AEs and serious AEs occurred in eight pts (30%) each. There were no Gr5 AEs. AEs relating to M and Len occurred in 20 (74%) and 10 pts (37%) respectively. No AEs led to the withdrawal of M or Len; two pts had M-related AEs leading to M dose delays, six pts (22%) had Len-related AEs leading to Len dose interruption and/or reduction. CRS events were Gr1 (7/8 pts) or Gr2 (1/8 pts). Six out of eight pts experienced CRS events in C1D1-7; two out of eight had Gr1 CRS events in C2. The median time to CRS onset was 1 day after the first dose (1-28 days); median duration was 3 days (2-5 days). All CRS events were resolved without sequelae. No pts required tocilizumab, ICU admission, high flow oxygen, or vasopressor support. Five pts (19%) reported 14 events of Gr3-4 neutropenia between D41 and 218, lasting 6-16 days, all resolved, with one pt receiving primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis and two pts receiving G-CSF treatment. No febrile neutropenia events occurred. The efficacy-evaluable population (13 pts) included all pts who had been assessed for response at any time on the study, withdrawn from treatment/study prior to reaching their first response assessment, or were on the study long enough to reach their first scheduled response assessment (planned per protocol for D15-21). The objective response rate at data cutoff was 92%. Complete (10 pts, 77%) and partial (2 pts, 15%) metabolic response (PMR) and stable disease (1 pt, 8%) were observed. One pt with initial PMR experienced PD after C8. M + Len appears to have an acceptable safety profile in R/R FL pts with >=1 prior therapy line and encouraging preliminary anti-lymphoma activity. These data support initiation of a randomised Phase III study of M + Len versus rituximab+Len.

AB  - Background: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)polatuzumab vedotin (pola)and pinatuzumab vedotin (pina)showed clinical activity and tolerability in phase 1 trials. The aim of this multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study was to compare rituximab plus pola (R-pola)or pina (R-pina)in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Method(s): In this phase 2 randomised study at 39 investigational sites in six countries, patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of a dynamic hierarchical randomisation scheme, to receive R-pola or R-pina (375 mg/m2 rituximab plus 2.4 mg/kg ADCs)every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 1 year. Treatment allocations were not masked to the investigator, patients or sponsor after the patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability, and antitumour response. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01691898, and is closed to accrual. Finding(s): 81 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 42 with follicular lymphoma were recruited between Sept 27, 2012, and Oct 10, 2013, and were assigned to treatment. 81 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41 patients with follicular lymphoma were eligible for analysis. Of the 42 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received R-pina, 25 (60%, 95% CI 43-74)achieved an objective response and 11 (26%, 95% CI 14-42)achieved a complete response. Of the 39 patients in this cohort who received R-pola, 21 (54%, 95% CI 37-70)achieved an objective response, and eight (21%, 95% CI 9-36)achieved a complete response. Of the 21 patients in the follicular lymphoma cohort who received R-pina, 13 (62%, 95% CI 38-82)achieved an objective response, and one (5%, 95% CI 0.1-24)achieved a complete response. Of the 20 patients in this cohort who received R-pola, 14 (70%, 95% CI 46-88)achieved an objective response, and nine (45%, 95% CI 23-68)achieved a complete response. In the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort, grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 33 (79%)of 42 patients receiving R-pina (most common were neutropenia [29%]and hyperglycaemia [10%]; nine [21%]grade 5 adverse events, five of which were infection-related), and in 30 (77%)of 39 patients receiving R-pola (most common were neutropenia [23%], anaemia [8%]and diarrhoea [8%]; no grade 5 adverse events). In the follicular lymphoma cohort, grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 13 (62%)of 21 patients receiving R-pina (most common were neutropenia [29%]and hyperglycaemia [14%]; no grade 5 adverse events)and in ten (50%)of 20 patients receiving R-pola (most common were neutropenia [15%]and diarrhoea [10%]; one grade 5 adverse event). Interpretation(s): R-pina and R-pola are potential treatment options in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Pola was selected by the study funder for further development in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, partly because of longer durations of response than pina, and an overall benefit-risk favouring R-pola.

AB  - Background: High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by transplantation of autologous haemopoietic stem cells is frequently done as part of first-line therapy in young patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma. We investigated whether HDT with cytotoxic agents identical to those used for conventional therapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) improved survival outcome compared with conventional chemotherapy when rituximab was added to both modalities. Method(s): We did an open-label, randomised trial comparing conventional chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone) and rituximab (R-CHOEP-14) with dose-escalated sequential HDT and rituximab (R-MegaCHOEP) followed by repetitive ASCT in high-risk (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index [IPI] 2 or 3) patients aged 18-60 years with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients received radiotherapy for bulky, extranodal disease, or both. Randomisation (1:1) used the Pocock minimisation algorithm; patients were stratified by age-adjusted IPI factors, bulky disease, and centre. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. All analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00129090. Finding(s): 136 patients were randomly assigned to R-CHOEP-14 and 139 to R-MegaCHOEP. 130 patients in the R-CHOEP-14 group and 132 in the R-MegaCHOEP group were included in the intention-to-treat population. After a median of 42 months (IQR 29-59), 3-year event-free survival was 69.5% (95% CI 61.3-77.7) in the R-CHOEP-14 group and 61.4% (52.8-70.0) in the R-MegaCHOEP group (p=0.14; hazard ratio 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-2.0). All 128 evaluable patients treated with R-MegaCHOEP had grade 4 leucopenia, as did 48 (58.5%) of 82 patients with documented blood counts in the R-CHOEP-14 group. All 128 evaluable patients in the R-MegaCHOEP group had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, as did 26 (33.8%) of 77 patients in the R-CHOEP-14 group with documented blood counts. The most important non-haematological grade 3 or 4 adverse event was infection, which occurred in 96 (75.0%) of 128 patients treated with R-MegaCHOEP and in 40 (31.3%) of 128 patients treated with R-CHOEP-14. Interpretation(s): In young patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma, R-MegaCHOEP was not superior to conventional R-CHOEP therapy and was associated with significantly more toxic effects. R-CHOEP-14 with or without radiotherapy remains a treatment option for these patients, with encouraging efficacy. Funding(s): Deutsche Krebshilfe. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Follicular lymphoma can be dividedin to three main subgroups: localised, advanced stageasymptomatic and advanced stage symptomaticdisease. There is as yet no evidence that chemotherapyor immunochemotherapy prolongs the life of patientsin the first two categories; the first is still best treatedwith local radiation with no evidence of any benefitfor additional therapy and the second by observationuntil symptomatic progression, although there are anumber of studies suggesting a delay in the need forchemotherapy by the use of monoclonal antibodiesthere is no conclusive evidence of long term benefitor prolongation of survival by early intervention. Inpatients with advanced stage symptomatic disease, orthose who in clinical trials fulfil the establishedGELF or BNLI criteria for therapy, progression freesurvival (PFS) has been significantly prolonged bythe use of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab incombination with chemotherapy either CVP CHOPor Bendamustine, with Fludarabine based regimensfalling out of favour as a consequence of concernsabout long term marrow toxicity and opportunisticinfection. Although anthracycline based regimensmay yield superior results to CVP, a large scale randomised study demonstrated that the combination ofBendamustine with Rituximab produced longer progression free survival than R-CHOP and this combination has now become standard of care (SOC) inmost European centres with a PFS over 5 years.Additional benefit may be observed with the use ofRituximab maintenance therapy after induction,albeit with different induction regimens, prolongingthe median duration of first remission to over 7 years, with the best results seen in those patients with anegative PET scan after the conclusion of inductionchemotherapy It is against this background that anynon chemotherapy based therapy will need to bejudged. Long term follow up data on the use ofsingle agent Rituximab as first line therapy with 2year maintenance therapy may be associated with prolonged PFS with a small cohort of patients remainingdisease free for up to 8 years, but the majority of thesepatients had a low tumour burden and the time ofdiagnosis with no immediate clinical requirement forchemotherapy More promising are the data on thecombination of the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide in combination with Rituximab, one retrospective analysis from MDACC showing anequivalent PFS with the R2 regimen compared to multiagent chemotherapy, and a prospective phase II trialfrom the same institution showing high response rateswith this chemotherapy free regimen, but as Buskepoints out in an accompanying editorial "Rituximabplus chemotherapy combinations are uniformlyaccepted as standard treatment for follicular lymphoma, underlining that we are still dependent on achemotherapy backbone if we want to offer patientswith follicular lymphoma the most effective treatmentpossible". A similar prospective study from the SAKKgroup shows a high response to this combination butno long term PFS data are yet available There arenow limited data from small phase II trials whereRituximab is combined with the bcl2 inhibitor "venetoclax" or the PI3kinase inhibitor Idelalisib, but thereare no definitive results that would enable us to conclude that we can yet discard chemotherapy fromfirst line treatment for Follicular lymphoma We alsohave to remember that even if impressive data are published in the near future, cost, toxicity and the sideeffects of long term usage of novel agents have to beset against the considerable achievements possiblewith short course non toxic chemo-immunotherapy.

AB  - The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (in particular rituximab) in the treatment algorithm of follicular lymphoma has signiicantly improved the median survival of this disease. Nevertheless, with the exception of a few special cases, it remains an incurable disease. A number of questions remain open and we are going to discuss three of them: Is watch and wait still an option? Is R-CHOP the standard first-line treatment? What is the role of autologous and allogeneic transplantation? The attitude of watching and waiting is regularly challenged because of concerns that delaying treatment could cause irreversible organ damage, permit the general condition of the patient to reduce, allow the appearance of chemotherapy resistant clones or transformation to high-grade lymphoma. Studies and experience conirm that, due to the usually slow progression of the disease, if a strict policy of regular follow- up visits is in place, organ damage and performance status reductions are readily recognized and dealt with. Studies also show that resistance to chemotherapy is not dependent on stage and inally transformation to high-grade is independent from the timing of first-line treatment. The 4 randomised studies performed in the last 2 decades confirmed that watch and wait does not confer a worse survival compared to immediate initial treatment. The very good partial and complete response rates and response duration seen with aggressive irst-line treatment, as CHOP combined with rituximab, has prompted some cooperative groups and centers to elect this regimen as a standard irst-line. Nevertheless, many studies have shown in the past that increased response rate and duration do not translate into prolonged survival. This is still true today and the comparison of many studies with different kinds of protocols, ranging from single agent chemo- or immunotherapy to very complex and aggressive combination treatments all show in the long term (as 7 years follow- up) similar progression free survival rates. In addition, the recent demonstration that the combination of rituximab and single agent bendamustine is better tolerated and as active as R-CHOP will further question the primate of R-CHOP as irst- line treatment. Several randomised trials are still ongoing to clarify which irst-line treatment, if any, is optimal for follicular lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation proved to be a good salvage treatment for patients in irst or second relapse. According to one small randomised and a few historical studies, this strategy could prolong survival compared to standard salvage chemo- immunotherapy. Nevertheless, in irst-line, four randomised studies show no advantage for this strategy. It is probable that the secondary MDS/AML and the acute toxicities could jeopardise the minimal survival advantage. On the other hand allogeneic transplantation is probably the sole modality with curative potential in this disease. Nevertheless, it is bound to very important acute toxicity, translating in almost 50% early deaths in the fist year after transplantation. Because of this, despite of the curative potential, this modality is kept for patients with early aggressive relapse, who are young and it enough to tolerate the treatment. In conclusion the treatment algorithm for irst-line follicular lymphoma should consider prognostic factors, symptoms and patient subjective priority to choose among watch and wait, intensive treatment or a milder treatment with single agents.

AB  - Objectives: Assess the effects of rituximab on salivary gland (SG) histopathology and systemically on the T‐cell compartment in the Trial for Anti‐B‐Cell Therapy in patients with primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (TRACTISS) cohort. Methods: 26 subjects randomised to rituximab or placebo consented for SG biopsy at baseline, weeks 16 and 48. Biopsies were fluorescently assessed for B‐cells (CD20+), T‐cells (CD3+), follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (CD21+) and plasma cells (CD138+). Digital imaging analysis and semi‐quantitative grading quantified SG inflammation. RNA extracted from matched SGs underwent sequencing and gene signature‐based analysis (xCell) to infer 64 immune cell types. Matched sera were assessed for T‐helper cytokines and B‐lymphocyte chemoattractant (CXCL13) using LEGENDplexTM and ELISA immunoassays, respectively. Results: Two cycles of rituximab prevented new B‐cell infiltration, development of FDC networks within SG inflammatory aggregates and ectopic GC organisation at 48 weeks. Gene enrichment analysis (xCell) demonstrated a prevention of class‐switched‐ and memory B‐cell infiltration by rituximab, with no effect on T‐cells or plasma cells. The reduction of ELS organisation was confirmed by transcriptomic analysis showing a downregulation of lymphocyte recruitment and ectopic GC organisation genes, such as CXCL13, CCR7, CCL19 and LTβ. The analysis of placebo SGs transcriptomics at week 48 showed a higher expression of ectopic GC organisation genes in females compared to male subjects, suggesting a gender‐driven difference in SG inflammation progression. Peripheral markers of salivary gland inflammation and SG GC organisation, such as CXCL13, were reduced after rituximab, together with T‐cell cytokines IFN‐g, IL‐4, IL‐17F, IL‐21, known to be involved in ectopic lymphomagenesis. Conclusions: Rituximab preserves residual SG function by preventing worsening SG inflammation and ELS formation compared to placebo, by affecting FDC network development and downregulating genes involved in B‐cell migration and organisation. These results reflect the clinical improvement of unstimulated whole salivary flow observed at week 48 in rituximab‐treated patients in the TRACTISS trial.

AB  - Objectives: Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to mobilise haematopoietic stem cells. Biosimilar filgrastim is now available in Europe. No differences were observed between biosimilar filgrastim (n=40) and a retrospective cohort of patients receiving originator filgrastim for stem cell mobilisation in a previous comparison, although no safety findings were reported (Lefrere et al. Adv Ther 2011;28:304-10). We compared the efficacy and safety of a biosimilar filgrastim (Zarzio, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) with originator filgrastim (Neupogen, Amgen) in patients with haematological malignancies. Method(s): A total of 108 patients were included in this study, 59 of whom were female (49 male), with an overall median age of 51 years (range 19-69). Patients had multiple myeloma (n=46), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=26), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=28) or other diagnosis (n=8). Median time from diagnosis to mobilisation was 10 months (range 3-122). After administration of mobilising regimens (primarily high-dose etoposide, high-dose cyclophosphamide, intermediate-dose Ara C or ESHAP), patients were randomised to a standard daily 10 mug/kg dose of Zarzio (n=54) or Neupogen (n=54). Result(s): Median duration of G-CSF administration was 8 days with both Zarzio (range 4-17) and Neupogen (range 4-14). Both groups had a median of one apheresis with a median time until first apheresis of 11 days. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the median (range) number of mobilised CD34+ cells/muL in peripheral blood (Zarzio, 62.0 [2-394]; Neupogen, 47.5 [2-370]) or the number of CD34+ cells/ kg body weight (Zarzio, 9.1 [0-23]; Neupogen, 9.4 [6-48]). Five patients (9%) in each group did not mobilise sufficient CD34+ cells. The adverse event profile was comparable between the Zarzio and Neupogen groups, with similar occurrence of neutropenic fever (9 vs 11 patients) and bone pain (8 vs 6 patients). Conclusion(s): Zarzio demonstrated similar efficacy and safety as the reference filgrastim (Neupogen) in haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in patients with haematological malignancies.

AB  - Advanced stage symptomatic follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is rarely, if ever, curable with conventional chemotherapy. Patients classically experience a pattern of remission and relapse, eventually dying of their disease. Data from a number of large-scale randomised phase III trials, both as first-line therapy and in relapsed/refractory patients, comparing rituximab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone indicate that the addition of rituximab to a number of different chemotherapy regimens increases response rates and progression-free survival (PFS), without significantly increasing toxicity. Moreover, in four trials, three in first-line and one in relapsed disease, a significant overall survival benefit has been observed for rituximab combination therapy. These data indicate that patients with follicular NHL who require therapy should now receive rituximab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Additionally, a strong case remains for offering rituximab-based therapy to patients with relapsed disease who have not previously received it, and in those who have previously responded well to this agent. Rituximab maintenance therapy has also been shown to significantly prolong PFS after rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease and in newly diagnosed patients who have not received rituximab during induction, and the benefit of maintenance after immunochemotherapy in relapsed patients may yet be mirrored by ongoing studies in the first-line setting. This overview considers the most recently published clinical trials of rituximab and their potential effect on clinical practice in the treatment of follicular NHL. © 2006 The Royal College of Radiologists.

AB  - Optimum treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma remains challenging because there have not been any large randomised clinical trials of this rare tumour. Drugs used in treating systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma have mostly proven ineffective because of difficulties crossing the blood-brain barrier. The recognition of the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate was a substantial therapeutic breakthrough and further advances, such as the development of polychemotherapy regimens, have built on this. Whole-brain radiotherapy can consolidate response to chemotherapy, but the associated toxic effects of chemoradiation can be unacceptable. Other effective approaches include disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the use of high-dose chemotherapy. Recently, there have been attempts to optimise multi-drug chemotherapy regimens by focusing on improving survival and reducing toxic effects. A promising area of research is the incorporation of novel targeted drugs into standard treatment frameworks. In the future, greater cooperation between research groups should hopefully lead to further therapeutic advances.

AB  - Radio-immunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) has been first approved in 2004 as a treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma (FL). In April 2008, the label has been extended to the consolidation therapy after remission induction in previously untreated patients with FL on the basis of the First-line indolent trial (FIT) phase III randomised study of Zevalin as front-line consolidation versus no further treatment. Consolidation of first remission with Zevalin (15 MBq/kg), 6 to 12 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose in advanced-stage FL is highly effective with no unexpected toxicities, prolonging PFS by 2 years and resulting in 77% PR-to-CR conversion rates regardless of type of first-line induction treatment. An assessment of the dosimetry of 90-Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in the FIT study indicated that consolidation treatment was safe in all patients, including those with a CR after induction therapy. The consolidation strategy with Zevalin, as a single agent or combined with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is currently investigated in other types of B-cell lymphomas. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - We investigated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of two B-cell purging methods in patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving autologous stsem cell transplantation. Myeloid and immune recoveries between the methods were compared. Twenty-seven patients were randomised to either in vivo purging with rituximab or ex vivo purging by CD34+ cell selection. Both purging methods were efficient at eliminating B-cells in infusates. When compared with in vivo purging, ex vivo purging was associated with CD34+ cell loss and delayed median neutrophil (10 d vs. 11 d) and platelet (12.5 d vs. 17 d) count recoveries. Lymphocyte recovery was similar in both groups, but immunoglobulin recovery was delayed after in vivo purging. Late-infectious complications were few in both arms. At a median follow-up of 27 months, 2-year probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) rates were 81% for in vivo purging and 76% for ex vivo purging (P = 0.66). When compared with 53 unpurged patients, all 27 purged patients had improved 3-year probabilities of overall survival (89% vs. 70%, P = 0.014) and a trend for improved EFS (78% vs. 57%, P = 0.075). In conclusion, although both purging methods were feasible and safe, rituximab purging was superior as it did not impair CD34+ cell mobilisation and was associated with faster myeloid recovery. Further studies are needed to determine whether rituximab purging is more effective than the use of unpurged autografts.

AB  - Peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT) from unrelated donors (n = 37) were compared with bone marrow transplants (BM, bone marrow group, n = 37) in a matched pair analysis. Ten patients (2, class 1) in the alloPBSCT group and seven patients (2, class 1) in the BM group had one HLA locus mismatch donor, respectively. The following factors were matched: HLA-compatibility, diagnosis, disease stage, age and gender. The median age in the PBSC group was 37 years (19-56, excluding one 6-year-old child) and in the BM group 37 years (18-53). The BM group consisted of 12 females and 25 males, 17 females and 20 males were in the PBSC group. Twelve patients in the BM and 11 patients in the PBSC group were diagnosed with AMI,; 7/7, ALL; 15/15, CML; 2/3, MDS; 1/1, NHL. Thirty-four (14/20) of the 74 patients (45%) were considered as high risk patients. The conditioning regimen was BU/CY for standard risk patients with myeloid diseases (31 patients) and TBI/CY for ALL and NHL patients (36 patients); six patients received intensified conditioning with VP16 (2 patients), thiotepa (2 patients) or melphalan (1 patient). The GVHD prophylaxis regimen was used according to the Seattle protocol. DFS was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days, in PBSC and BM transplants, respectively. The median time to leukocyte engraftment in PBSC patients was 14 days (range 6-26 days) and in the BM group 19 days (range 9-29 days; P < 0.02). The time of platelet engraftment did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 40% (four patients died, 13%) in the PBSC group and 20)% (three patients died, 8%) in the BM group, respectively (P < 0.05, log-rank). No signs of aGVHD were found in 19% of the patients in the PBSC and 27% in the BM group. Our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT does lead to a significantly faster leukocyte engraftment. The significant increase with regard to the incidence and shorter time of onset of severe aGVHD in PBSC patients, compared to marrow transplant patients, need to be confirmed in a randomised trial.

AB  - Background. The ability of allogeneic transplants performed using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen to deliver long term disease free survival is dependent on the genesis of an immunologically mediated graft-versus tumor (GVT) effect. Post-transplant immunosuppression plays an important role in limiting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) but also modulates a GVT effect. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the most commonly utilised form of GVHD prophylaxis after a RIC allograft but its impact on transplant outcome has not been studied. Aim. We wished to examine the impact of CsA dose intensity on disease relapse and overall survival (OS) in patients transplanted using an alemtuzumab based RIC regimen. Methods. CsA exposure in the first 21 days posttransplant was measured in 132 patients and correlated with overall survival, and relapse risk. 68 patients were transplanted for a myeloid malignancy (acute myeloid leukemia (n=41), myelodysplasia (n=17)) and 74 for a lymphoid malignancy (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=51) or Hodgkin's disease (n=23)). All patients with a myeloid malignancy were transplanted using a regimen consisting of fludarabine, melphalan and alemtuzumab (FMA). Patients with an underlying lymphoid disease were transplanted using FMA (n=31) or a regimen consisting of BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, melphalan and alemtuzumab (BEAMA) (n=43). 39 patients had chemoresistant disease at the time of transplant. All patients received intravenous CsA at a loading dose of 5 mg/kg on day -1 followed by 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. Patients were switched to oral CsA prior to discharge. Trough CsA levels were measured thrice weekly for the first three weeks after stem cell infusion and the dose of CsA adjusted to achieve levels in the region of 200-300 mug/L during this period. Trough levels obtained during the first 21 days post-transplant were used to calculate the CsA area under the curve (AUC) for each patient. Results. 71 patients were transplanted from HLA identical siblings and 61 from volunteer unrelated donors. The median age of the whole group was 48 years (range 17-68). The incidence of acute GVHD (Grades 2-4) was 34%. The median CsA AUC in the first 21 days post-transplant was 3682 microg.hr/l (range 2162-8084). In univariate analysis the presence of chemoresistant disease at the time of transplant and a high CsA AUC were both associated with a decreased OS. In multivariate analyses chemoresistant disease (HR=2.60, 95% CI 1.44-4.65, p=0.002) and linearly increasing CsA AUC were associated with an increased hazard of death (HR=1.1, 95%CI 1.02-1.24, p=0.02). The two year OS for patients with a CsA AUC less than 3682 microg.hr/l was 77% compared to 30% for patients with CsA greater than 3682 microg.hr/l (p<0.0001). Increased CsA AUC and the presence of chemorefractory disease at the time of transplant were associated with an increased risk of relapse in univariate analysis. In multivariate analyses only increased CsA AUC was significantly associated with a higher risk of relapse (OR=4.1, 95% CI 2.50-6.81, p<0.0001). Decreased CsA AUC and the use of an unrelated donor were associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD in univariate analysis. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the use of an unrelated donor (HR=2.9, 9%% CI 1.36-6.36, p=0.006) and linearly decreasing CsA AUC were significantly associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD (HR=1.2, 95% CI 1.05-1.43, p=0.01). Conclusions. These data identify CsA exposure as a critical and manipulable determinant of outcome after a T depleted RIC allograft. They support a randomised trial aimed at identifying the optimal CsA dose schedule in this population of patients. It will be important to determine whether post-transplant CsA exposure plays a similar role in determining outcome after a T replete RIC allograft.
