Although this vector is safe and immunogenic in humans, efforts remain on-going to enhance immunogenicity through various approaches such as using stronger promoters to boost transgene expression. We previously reported that endogenous MVA promoters such as pB8 and pF11 increased transgene expression and immunogenicity, as compared to the conventional p7.5 promoter. Here, we show that both promoters also rivalled the mH5 promoter in enhancing MVA immunogenicity. We investigated the mechanisms behind this improved immunogenicity and show that it was a result of strong early transgene expression in vivo, rather than in vitro as would normally be assessed. Moreover, keeping the TK gene intact resulted in a modest improvement in immunogenicity. Utilizing pB8 or pF11 as ectopic promoters at the TK locus instead of their natural loci also increased transgene expression and immunogenicity. In addition to a reporter antigen, the pF11 promoter was tested with the expression of two vaccine antigens for which cellular immunogenicity was significantly increased as compared to the p7.5 promoter. Our data support the use of the pF11 and pB8 promoters for improved immunogenicity in future MVA-vectored candidate vaccines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) of M. tuberculosis was expressed in Brassica oleracea var. italica via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to facilitate oral delivery of antigen. ESAT-6 gene was cloned using Gateway (R) cloning strategy. Transformation and presence of transgene was confirmed through PCR. Expression level of transgene was calculated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the maximum integrated transgene number was two. Maximum amount of total soluble fraction of ESAT-6 was evaluated by immunoblotting, estimated to accumulate up to 0.5% of total soluble protein. The recombinant ESAT-6 protein was further purified and detected using silver staining and Western blotting. ESAT-6 protein induced humoral immune response in mice immunized orally and subcutaneously. The expression of M. tuberculosis antigen in edible plants could aid in the development of cost-effective and oral delivery of an antigen-based subunit vaccine against TB.

Vaccination with DnaK alone resulted in protective immunity comparable to BCG vaccination against tuberculosis in mice.

This study aimed to determine whether patients who experience tuberculosis relapse have different immune responses to mycobacteria in vitro than patients who remain cured for 2 years. METHODS: Patients with an initial episode of pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited in South Africa. Diluted blood, collected at diagnosis and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, was cultured with live Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 6 days, and cellular RNA was frozen. Gene expression in samples from 10 patients who subsequently experienced relapse, confirmed by strain genotyping, was compared to that in samples from patients who remained cured, using microarrays. RESULTS: At diagnosis, expression of 668 genes was significantly different in samples from patients who experienced relapse, compared with expression in patients who remained successfully cured; these differences persisted for at least 4 weeks. Gene ontology and biological pathways analyses revealed significant upregulation of genes involved in cytotoxic cell-mediated killing. Results were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis in a wider patient cohort. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that patients who will subsequently experience relapse exhibit altered immune responses, including excessively robust cytolytic responses to M. tuberculosis in vitro, at the time of diagnosis, compared with patients who will achieve durable cure. Together with microbiological and clinical indices, these differences could be exploited in drug development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

It has been suggested that the immune response to Hsp60/65 may be the link between exposure to microorganisms and increased cardiovascular risk. Additionally, the high cholesterol levels found in atherosclerosis could modulate host immunity. In this context, we evaluated if an atherogenic diet could modulate the immune response induced by the DNA-HSP65 vaccine. C57BL/6 mice (4-6 animals per group) were initially submitted to a protocol of atherosclerosis induction and then immunized by the intramuscular or intradermal route with 4 doses of 100 mug DNA-HSP65. On day 150 (15 days after the last immunization), the animals were sacrificed and antibodies and cytokines were determined. Vaccination by the intramuscular route induced high levels of anti-Hsp65 IgG2a antibodies, but not anti-Hsp65 IgG1 antibodies and a significant production of IL6, EFN-gamma and IL-10, but not IL-5, indicating a Th1 profile. Immunization by the intradermal route triggered a mixed pattern (Th1/Th2) characterized by synthesis of anti-Hsp65 IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies and production of high levels of EL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma.

Additionally, proteins exclusive to the secretomes of MAB R variants had higher antigenic densities than those exclusive to S variants, independently of the subspecies. For all investigated isolates, ES proteins had a significantly higher antigenic density than non-ES proteins. We identified 337 MAB ES proteins with homologues in previously investigated M. tuberculosis secretomes.

The diagnosis was based on a history of recurrent severe infections, impaired respiratory burst, and the demonstration of an underlying mutation by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or RT-PCR analysis, followed by genomic DNA or cDNA sequencing. Results. Seven unrelated patients were found to have the X-linked form of CGD (X-CGD). Heterogeneous mutations affected the CYBB gene: two insertions, one substitution, and four splice site defects; two of them are novel. Seven patients presented with one of the autosomal recessive forms of CGD (A47-CGD); all had the most common mutation, a DELTAGT deletion in exon 2 of the NCF1 gene. Pneumonia was the most frequent clinical feature, followed by pyoderma, sinusitis, otitis, and liver abscess. Patients with X-CGD were more likely to have initial infections before age 2 years and to have inflammatory obstructive granulomas later. None of the patients had severe adverse reactions to BCG immunization. Conclusions. X-CGD patients from Latin America showed a high degree of molecular heterogeneity, including two novel mutations. Their clinical characteristics included early onset of infections and eventual obstructive granulomas. A47-CGD represented 50% of the reported cases, a higher prevalence than reported in other series. \textcopyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

N.",https://www.nature.com/emm/,,,,"The first line of host defense against infectious agents involves activation of innate immune signaling pathways that recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Key triggers of innate immune signaling are now known to include microbial-specific nucleic acid, which is rapidly detected in the cytosol of the cell. For example, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) have evolved to detect viral RNA species and to activate the production of host defense molecules and cytokines that stimulate adaptive immune responses. In addition, host defense countermeasures, including the production of type I interferons (IFNs), can also be triggered by microbial DNA from bacteria, viruses and perhaps parasites and are regulated by the cytosolic sensor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING). STING-dependent signaling is initiated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) generated by intracellular bacteria following infection. CDNs can also be synthesized by a cellular synthase, cGAS, following interaction with invasive cytosolic self-DNA or microbial DNA species. The importance of STING signaling in host defense is evident since numerous pathogens have developed strategies to prevent STING function. Here, we review the relevance of STING-controlled innate immune signaling in host defense against pathogen invasion, including microbial endeavors to subvert this critical process.Copyright \textcopyright 2019, The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

DLL4 is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in a MyD88-dependent manner. We found that DLL4 expression was upregulated on bone marrow progenitor cells and APCs in mice infected with BCG Mycobacterium. Transfer of DLL4 + progenitor cells from infected hosts resulted in an increase DLL4+ myeloid cells in the spleen, indicating that expression of the dll4 gene is propagated throughout hematopoiesis. We also found an increase in DLL4+ monocytes from individuals who were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In latent individuals, DLL4 expression correlated with increased cytokine production from T cells in response to PPD stimulation. Finally, antibody blockade of DLL4 reduced T cell cytokine production from naive T cells stimulated with antigen. These results demonstrate that the Notch ligand DLL4 can influence T cell cytokine production in both humans and mice, and further reveal that expression of DLL4 is upregulated on early hematopoietic progenitors in response to chronic mycobacterial infection. These data suggest that widespread DLL4 expression may occur as a result of mycobacterial infection, and that this expression may alter CD4+ T cell responses to both previously encountered and novel antigens.Copyright \textcopyright 2016 Schaller, Allen, Kimura, Day and Kunkel.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

The virus rapidly spread to several countries around the world and caused severe respiratory illness to humans. Since the outbreak, researchers around the world have devoted maximum resources and effort to develop a potent vaccine that would offer protection to uninfected individuals against SARS-CoV2. Reverse vaccinology is a relatively new approach that thrives faster in vaccine research. In this study, we constructed Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL)-based multi-epitope vaccine using hybrid epitope prediction methods. A total of 121 immunogenic CTL epitopes were screened by various sequence-based prediction methods and docked with their respective HLA alleles using the AutoDock Vina v1.1.2. In all, 17 epitopes were selected based on their binding affinity, followed by the construction of multi-epitope vaccine by placing the appropriate linkers between the epitopes and tuberculosis heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) adjuvant. The final vaccine construct was modeled by the I-TASSER server and the best model was further validated by ERRAT, ProSA, and PROCHECK servers. Furthermore, the molecular interaction of the constructed vaccine with TLR4 was assessed by ClusPro 2.0 and PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY) server. The immune simulation analysis confirms that the constructed vaccine was capable of inducing long-lasting memory T helper (Th) and CTL responses. Finally, the nucleotide sequence was codon-optimized by the JCAT tool and cloned into the pET21a (+) vector.

The mice treated with Ag85A/B chimeric DNA showed significantly higher numbers of T cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), more IFN-gamma in splenocyte culture supernatant, more Th1 and Tc1 cells, and higher ratios of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 cells in whole blood, indicating a predominant Th1 immune response to treatment. Infected mice treated with doses of 100 mug Ag85A/B chimeric DNA had an extended time until death of 50% of the animals that was markedly longer than the saline and vector control groups, and the death rate at 1 month after the last dose was lower than that in the other groups. Compared with the saline group, 100 mug Ag85A/B chimeric DNA and 100 mug Ag85A DNA reduced the pulmonary bacterial loads by 0.79 and 0.45 logs, and the liver bacterial loads by 0.52 and 0.50 logs, respectively. Pathological changes in the lungs were less, and the lesions were more limited.

In a previous report, we demonstrated that recombinant BCG (rBCG) expressing the full-length gas gene of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (rBCG-SIVgag) induced Gag-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity, T cell. proliferation, gamma interferon (IFN gamma), and serum IgG responses in guinea pigs immunized intradermally (i.d.) with 0.1 mg for the 1-year period of study. Especially, the production of long-lasting Gag-specific serum IgG in the vaccinated animals perhaps reflects the persistent antigenic stimulation by rBCG-SIVgag. How long, we questioned, wilt such immune responses to Gag engendered by the rBCG-SIVgag vaccination persist without booster immunizations? To learn this, we examined Gag-specific IgG production in sera and Gag-specific IFN gamma mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in guinea pigs vaccinated with rBCG-SIVgag i.d. (0.1 mg) or orally (80 mg x 2) during a 3-year period. As a result, Gag-specific serum IgG was highly generated for 3 years at similar levels between the i.d. and the orally immunized guinea pigs (IgG2 > IgG1). The enhancement of IFN gamma mRNA expression by in vitro restimulation with Gag antigen was also detected in PBMC from the two immunization groups throughout the 3-year observation period. In guinea pigs immunized i.d. with rBCG-SIVgag, a high level of Gag-specific IFN gamma response was observed at 1 year after vaccination, whereas the response has waned gradually. The current study indicates that i.d. and oral inoculations of rBCG-SIVgag elicit stable, strong, Gag-specific serum IgG production white exhibiting the different kinetics of Gag-specific IFN gamma responses between i.d. and oral vaccination routes. This suggests that the rBCG vector system expressing an appropriate size of foreign antigen gene should be suited for the induction of the antigen-specific humoral. immunity concomitant with an IFN gamma response.

Despite major advances in vaccine research and our understanding of the human immune system, the rules of immune protection against TB remain unclear. Recently, more emphasis has been placed on investigating the antibody response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens during infection using mainly microarray technology. However, this technology comes at its own cost and limitations and might therefore be less available to researchers. Here, we report a novel approach for assessing antigens of serum antibodies from TB patients using state-of-the-art proteomics. In a proof-of-concept study, the human antibody response to M.tb antigens was investigated in patients with active TB and healthy controls. M.tb antigens were isolated from bacterial lysates using purified serum antibodies from patients and healthy controls. The identities of isolated antigens were determined by tryptic digestion, measurement using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer and MaxQuant analysis. Unique antigens were detected in TB patients or healthy controls - TB patients showing more reactivity to Esx proteins and virulence factors. Furthermore, cross-reactivity was observed to M.tb antigens by antibodies in healthy controls. These findings reiterate observations made in recent microarray studies, but also add novel antigens detected in TB patients for the first time. Thus, this approach might prove an important alternative to microarray technology in the investigation of the antibody response to M.tb infection. Furthermore, this technology might broaden available targets for vaccination and facilitate the future development of an effective TB vaccine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferongamma release assays (IGRA) are used in the diagnosis of LTBI but there isn't a standard practice. The aim of this study is to compare the TST and T-SPOT.TB test efficiency in the diagnosis of LTBI in HIV-infected patients. Patients who had no previous active TB infection, who were not treated for LTBI and who had no active tuberculosis infection at the time of admission were included in the study. A total of 100 HIV-infected patients who were admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology out-patient clinic between June 2015 and March 2016 were evaluated cross-sectionally. CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in the last one month were detected. All patients underwent chest radiography at the time of admission. Patients who are not considered as active TB infection with clinical and laboratory findings and who had no TST within the last one month were included in the study. TST was performed after the blood samples were taken for T-SPOT.TB test. In our study, 87% of the patients were male and the mean age was 40.2. The mean CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 605 cells/mm(3) (26-1313). 16% of the patients had a history of encountring a person with tuberculosis and 81% had BCG vaccination scar. TST positivity and T-SPOT.TB positivity were 22.9% and 22%, respectively. The concordance between the two tests was found to be moderate (Kappa= 0.491). It was determined that BCG vaccination and the presence of a contact with a patient with TB did not affect TST and T-SPOT.TB test positivity (p> 0.05). There was a positive correlation between CD4+ T lymphocyte count and TST measurement values (r= 0.3, p= 0.003). Accordingly, as the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes increased, TST positivity increased (p= 0.007). T-SPOT.TB test was not affected by CD4+ T lymphocyte count (p= 0.289). Our study showed that TST was affected by CD4+ T lymphocyte count and patients' compliance with this test was also low. On the contrary T-SPOT.TB test was not affected by CD4+ T lymphocyte count. There was no statistically significant difference between T-SPOT.TB test positivity and CD4+ T lymphocyte count (p= 0.289). The concordance between the two tests was found to be moderate. It is thought that the main reason for the discordance between the tests is due to false negative or false positive results of TST. In conclusion, T-SPOT.TB was found more reliable in the diagnosis of LTBI in HIV-infected individuals. In the light of these findings, especially in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, T-SPOT.TB test can be considered for LTBI diagnosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Eradication of TB will require a more effective vaccine, yet evaluation of new vaccine candidates is hampered by lack of defined correlates of protection. Animal and human studies of intracellular pathogens have extensively evaluated polyfunctional + T cells producing multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2) as a possible correlate of protection from infection and disease. In this study, we review the published literature that evaluates whether or not BCG and/or novel TB vaccine candidates induce polyfunctional CD4+ T cells and if these T cell responses correlate with vaccine-mediated protection. Ample evidence suggests that BCG and several novel vaccine candidates evaluated in animal models and humans induce polyfunctional CD4+ T cells. However, while a number of studies utilizing the mouse TB model support that polyfunctional CD4+ T cells are associated with vaccine-induced protection, other studies in mouse and human infants demonstrate no correlation between these T cell responses and protection. We conclude that induction of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells is certainly not sufficient and may not even be necessary to mediate protection and suggest that other functional attributes, such as additional effector functions, T cell differentiation state, tissue homing potential, or long-term survival capacity of the T cell may be equally or more important to promote protection. Thus, a correlate of protection for TB vaccine development remains elusive. Future studies should address polyfunctional CD4+ T cells within the context of more comprehensive immunological signatures of protection that include other functions and phenotypes of T cells as well as the full spectrum of immune cells and mediators that participate in the immune response against Mtb.Copyright \textcopyright 2017 Lewinsohn, Lewinsohn and Scriba.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Maybe"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Maybe""}",,

Identification of Mycobacterium isolates is essential for proper treatment of TB. The aim of this study was to identify Mycobacterium isolates collected from TB patients in Alborz Province, Iran, by region of differentiation (RD)-typing. Fifty samples from tuberculosis patients were cultured in pyruvate and glycerinated Lowenstein-Jensen medium. DNA was extracted from the isolates by the van Solingen method and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-16SrRNA, PCR-IS6110, and RD-typing with primers RD1, RD4, RD9, and RD12, respectively. Out of 50 isolates, only one isolate appeared negative in IS6110-PCR and was considered nontuberculosis complex. The remaining isolates gave PCR products of approximately 543 bp, 245 bp, 146 bp, 172 bp, 235 bp, and 369 bp with 16s-rRNA, IS6110-PCR, RD-1, RD-4, RD-9, and RD-12 PCR, respectively. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of oxyR pseudogene confirmed the results. All isolates except one from Alborz Province appeared positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on the obtained results, all isolates except one were identified as M. tuberculosis. The only negative isolate appeared 93% and 97% similar to Nocardia or Mycobacterium sp. (Mycobacterium neoaurum), respectively, based on sequencing and alignment of 16s-rRNA and hsp65. Accurate identification of Mycobacterium isolates is of utmost importance for proper and immediate treatment of TB patients. In this study, RD-typing appeared to be a suitable method for correct identification of M. tuberculosis isolates.Copyright \textcopyright 2016","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Based on this, a chimeric DNA vaccine HG856A encoding Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) immunodominant antigen Ag85A plus two copies of ESAT-6 was constructed. Potent humoral immune responses, as well as therapeutic effects induced by this DNA vaccine, were observed previously in M. tuberculosis-infected mice. In this study, we further evaluated the antigen-specific T cell immune responses and showed that repeated immunization with HG856A gave modest protection against M. tuberculosis challenge infection and significantly boosted the immune protection primed by BCG vaccination. Enhanced protection was accompanied by increased multifunctional Th1 CD4+ T cell responses, most notably by an elevated frequency of M. tuberculosis antigen-specific IL-2-producing CD4+ T cells post-vaccination.

We investigated total IgG and mycobacteria-specific antibodies in a cross-sectional study nested within a rural Ugandan General Population Cohort (GPC), in relation to HIV infection and the magnitude of HCMV IgG response. Methods Sera from 2189 individuals (including 27 sputum-positive TB cases) were analysed for antibodies against mycobacteria (Ag85A, PPD, LAM, ESAT6/CFP10) and HCMV, tetanus toxoid (TT) and total IgG. Results Anti-mycobacterial antibodies increased with age until approximately 20 years, when they plateaued. Higher HCMV exposure (measured by IgG) was associated with lower levels of some anti-mycobacterial antibodies, but no increase in total IgG. HIV infection was associated with a decrease in all anti-mycobacterial antibodies measured and with an increase in total IgG. Conclusions The increase in anti-mycobacterial antibodies with age suggests increasing exposure to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and to M.tb itself. HIV infection is associated with decreased levels of all mycobacterial antibodies studied here, and high levels of HCMV IgG are associated with decreased levels of some mycobacterial antibodies. These findings point towards the importance of humoral immune responses in HIV/TB co-infection and highlight a possible role of HCMV as a risk factor for TB disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Causative organisms were identified in 60% of cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was found to be the commonest (49% of cases). Overall, case fatality was 38.8% for all age groups, and 62.5% (15 of 25) for adults. Neurological sequelae occurred in 22.4%. Three of the adult cases were HIV seropositive. Seizures, but not duration of symptoms before admission, were associated with a poor prognosis. There was a significant rise in incidence related to a period of drought. Fifteen patients were reported with tuberculous meningitis, of whom five were known to be HIV seropositive; the case fatality was 73.3%.Conclusions - The aetiology and age distribution of cases of meningitis differs greatly from that in developed countries. Rising HIV infection may have an important impact on the future incidence of meningitis. The high case mortality found should encourage efforts towards earlier diagnosis and treatment, and strengthens the need to develop appropriate vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

New vaccines are desperately needed to decrease the worldwide burden of TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a recombinant strain of BCG that overproduces an L,D-transpeptidase in order to alter the bacterial peptidoglycan layer and consequently increase the ability of this immunogen to protect against virulent M. tuberculosis (Mtb). We demonstrate that this novel recombinant BCG protects mice against virulent Mtb at least as well as control BCG, as measured by its ability to reduce bacterial burden in lungs and spleen, reduce lung histopathology, and prolong survival. A nutrient starved recombinant BCG preparation, while offering comparable protection, elicited a response characterized by elevated levels of select Th1 cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant BCG overexpressing a L,D-transpeptidase that is nutrient starved elicits a stronger Th1 type response and is at least as protective as parent BCG. Results from this study suggest that nutrient starvation treatment of live BCG vaccines should be further investigated as a way to increase host induction of Th-1 related cytokines in the development of experimental anti-TB vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

A gene-modified DC vaccine expressing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) antigen 85A (Ag85A) was developed by using a recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral gene transfer vector (AdAg85A). AdAg85A-transduced DC vaccine (AdAg85/ DC) expressed higher levels of IL-12 and was much more immunogenic than Ag85 protein-loaded (pro/DC) or CD4/CD8 T cell peptide-loaded (pep/DC) DC vaccines. Compared to pro/DC or pep/DC, AdAg85/DC elicited a remarkably higher level of ex vivo IFN-gamma production by CD4 and CD8 T cells at weeks 2, 6, and 12 postimmunization, which was coupled with higher frequencies of antigen-specific T cells. By an in vivo CD8 or CD4 T cell cytotoxicity (CTL) assay, AdAg85/DC was shown to provoke much higher and more sustained levels of CD8 and CD4 CTL activity up to 12 weeks postimmunization. Intramuscular (im) AdAg85/DC immunization was more potent than the iv route of AdAg85/DC immunization. Such stronger immunogenicity of im AdAg85/DC vaccination was corroborated with better protection from M.tb challenge.

To address this problem, we used an algorithm to map ordinal predictions to a numeral space and averaging them, and based on it we developed the ISNPranker web-tool (http://isnpranker.semilab.ir/). It takes heterogonous outputs of different predictors and generates integrated numerical predictions and ranks SNPs based on them. Afterward, we used ISNPranker to identify the most deleterious coding SNPs (cSNPs) of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene. AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that governs many molecular and cellular mechanisms and cSNPs may affect its structure, interactions, and function. Forty validated cSNPs of AHR were initially analyzed using 16 publicly available SNP analyzers and the results were introduced to the ISNPranker and integrated predictions were obtained. The cSNPs were ranked in 34 levels of danger and rs200257782 in the ARNT dimerization domain (ADD121-289) of AHR was identified as the most deleterious cSNP. The rs148360742, which affect ADD40-79 and Hsp90 binding domain (HBD27-79) was in the second rank and the third and fourth ranks were occupied by ADD121-289-located variations rs571123681 and rs141667112 respectively.

We found that high concentrations of this antigen markedly inhibit Interferon-gamma production by T-cells and are working to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. Developing methods to enhance NK cell functions that favor protective immunity, increase interferon-gamma transcription, elicit protective pulmonary immune responses and prevent ESAT-6 from inhibiting T-cell function will contribute significantly to development of antituberculosis vaccines. \textcopyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Messenger RNA was isolated from the T-cells and used to evaluate the effects of treatment on IL-12p35, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 expression using RT-PCR. T-cells exposed to HEWL-treated mDCs expressed high IL-13 and moderate IL-10 and IFN-gamma, suggesting T-helper 2 (Th-2) bias. Addition of any cytokine during HEWL treatment of mDCs reduced subsequent expression of IL-10 and IL-13 by T-cells. Added IL-12 increased IFN-gamma mRNA. T-cells exposed to Mtb-treated mDCs expressed increased IFN-gamma and decreased IL-10 suggesting Th-1 bias. Addition of cytokines to mDCs treated with Mtb altered T-cell cytokine mRNA expression such that TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma or IL-12 increased IFN-gamma; IL-12 and IFN-gamma suppressed IL-10, while IL-10 and IL-12 enhanced IL-13. Messenger RNA for IL-4 and IL-12p35 was not detected in the T-cells. Results suggest Th-1/Th-2 type response bias in pigs T-cells as a function of antigen type and that cytokine environment at the time of antigen-mDC interaction alters cytokine profiles of T-cells responding to antigen-pulsed mDCs. Hence, cytokines may allow designed steering of porcine immune response. \textcopyright 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

But many significant obstacles remain, such as optimizing DNA vaccines for use in humans or large animals. The amount of doses, route and easiness of administration are also important points to consider in the design of new DNA vaccines. Heterologous prime-boost regimens probably represent the best hope for an improved DNA vaccine strategy. In this study, we have shown that heterologous prime-boost vaccination against tuberculosis (TB) using intranasal BCG priming/DNA-HSP65 boosting (BCGin/DNA) provided significantly greater protection than that afforded by a single subcutaneous or intranasal dose of BCG. In addition, BCGin/DNA immunization was also more efficient in controlling bacterial loads than were the other prime-boost schedules evaluated or three doses of DNA-HSP65 as a naked DNA. The single dose of DNA-HSP65 booster enhanced the immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous BCG vaccination, as evidenced by the significantly higher serum levels of anti-Hsp65 IgG2a Th1-induced antibodies, as well as by the significantly greater production of IFN-γ by antigen-specific spleen cells. The BCG prime/DNA-HSP65 booster was also associated with better preservation of lung parenchyma. The improvement of the protective effect of BCG vaccine mediated by a DNA-HSP65 booster suggests that our strategy may hold promise as a safe and effective vaccine against TB. © 2007 Gonçalves et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Included"", ""R2""=>""Included"", ""R3""=>""Included"", ""R4""=>""Included""}",,

C. and Zhu, B.",http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/vaccines/article/LiuHV5-2.pdf,,,,"Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was developed as an attenuated live vaccine for tuberculosis control nearly a century ago. Despite being the most widely used vaccine in human history, the mechanisms of attenuation of BCG remain poorly understood. BCG is not a single organism, but comprises a number of substrains that differ in genotypes and phenotypes. The impacts of these differences on BCG vaccine properties are largely unknown. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the development of sophisticated genome analysis techniques, coupled with advances in knowledge of the virulence mechanisms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have provided greater insights into the attenuation and evolution of BCG. This review article discusses these new developments, focusing on molecular mechanisms that contribute to the attenuation of BCG substrains. It is evident that BCG strains comprise natural mutants of major virulence factors of M. tb, including ESX-1, PDIM/PGL and PhoP, and that BCG substrains differ markedly in virulence level. The impacts of these findings on vaccine properties including adverse reaction effect, tuberculin reactivity and protective efficacy are discussed. These new insights have extremely important implications for national immunization programs and the development of future vaccines. \textcopyright2009 Landes Bioscience.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

However, BCG fails to adequately protect against pulmonary TB and reactivation of latent infections in adults. To overcome this problem, adequate booster is urgently desired in adult who received prior BCG vaccination, and appropriate animal models that substitute human cases would be highly valuable for further experimentation. Finding(s): The booster effect of the synthesized CpG oligomer (Oligo-B) on aged mice which had been primarily vaccinated with BCG at the age of 4-week old. The specific Th1 type reaction, production of interferon-gamma, in response to TB antigens, purified protein derivatives (PPD) and protection against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H37Rv decreased with increasing age and were not observed in 89-week old mice. In order to rejuvenate the Th1 type response against PPD and protection activity against MTB infection, Oligo-B, which is known to augment Th1 responses, was administered as a booster to 81-90-week old mice (late 50's in human equivalent) vaccinated with BCG at 4-week old. The boosting with Oligo-B increased the number of CD4+ CD44high CD62Lhigh, central memory type T cell. Furthermore, the Oligo-B boosting rejuvenated the ability of mice to protect against infection with MTB H37Rv. Conclusion(s): Th1-adjuvant CpG oligo DNA, such as Oligo-B, may be a promising booster when coupled with BCG priming. \textcopyright 2013 Taniguchi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Included""}",,

Main criteria for the diagnosis are: a previous contact with an infectious TB patient, a positive PPD test result and clinical - radiological signs and symptoms. Bacteriology plays a limited role in diagnosis; gastric aspirate is the most often used specimen for bacteriological examination in children. Culture is performed on solid egg-media, but other more recently developed culture media systems are available in reference laboratories. Nucleic acid amplification assays are also used, but its systematic quality control is still lacking. Their results should be considered only as complementary. Strengthening of the laboratory network will contribute to increase diagnostic certainty of childhood TB, to improve reliability of cases reported, and to a better knowledge of the drug resistance profile. Early diagnosis of TB in children, by contacts investigation of infectious patients, followed by preventive chemotherapy or treatment when necessary, may revert the current epidemiological situation.

Indeed, the misuse of antibiotics has led to, over the past 30 years, the emergence of a number of resistant bacterial strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Unfortunately, efforts to produce new antibiotics have not been sufficient to cope with the emergence of these new antibiotic-resistant (AR) strains.Areas covered: There is an urgent need to invent and employ unconventional strategies for antimicrobial drug development to tackle the rising global threats imposed by the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Herein, the authors discuss these novel design strategies and provide their expert perspective on the subject.Expert opinion: To deal with the growing threat of AR, it is important to cut down the use of antibiotics to the very minimum to diminish the risk of unknown drug-resistant bacteria and increase antibacterial vaccination programs. Furthermore, it is important to develop new classes of antibiotics that can deal with multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.Copyright \textcopyright 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Maybe"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Because BCG protection is variable and does not protects adults, there is a great need for a new vaccine against TB that does not represent a risk for immunocompromised patients and that is also capable of protecting adult individuals. MPT-51 is a protein found in the genome of mycobacteria and binds to the fibronectin of the extracellular matrix, which may have a role in host tissue attachment and virulence. In order to test the usefulness of MPT-51 as a subunit vaccine, BALB/c were vaccinated and challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The infection of BALB/c with M. tuberculosis increased the number of IFN-gamma+ T lymphocytes specific to MPT-51 in the spleen and lungs. Inoculation with rMPT-51/FIA and with rMPT-51/CpG DNA in non-infected BALB/c increased the amounts of IFN-gamma+ T lymphocytes. Inoculation with rMPT-51/FIA also induced a humoral response specific to MPT-51. CFU counts of lung tissues done 60 days after infection showed a reduction of about 2 log in the bacteria load in the group of animals inoculated with rMPT-51/CpG DNA.

For this purpose, we generated and evaluated two mutants of MAP strain K10: one mutant lacking the lprG gene (DELTAlprG) and the other lacking both genes lprG and p55 (DELTAlprG-p55). None of the mutant strains showed altered susceptibility to first-line and second-line antituberculosis drugs or ethidium bromide, only the double mutant had two-fold increase in clarithromycin susceptibility compared with the wild-type strain. The deletion of lprG and of lprG-p55 reduced the replication of MAP in bovine macrophages; however, only the mutant in lprG-p55 grew faster in liquid media and showed reduced viability in macrophages and in a mouse model. Considering that the deletion of both genes lprG-p55, but not that of lprG alone, showed a reduced replication in vivo, we can speculate that p55 contributes to the survival of MAP in this animal model.Copyright \textcopyright 2021 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

IL-27 is highly expressed during human tuberculosis (TB), and absence of IL-27R (Il27ra) specifically on T cells results in increased protection. IL-27R deficiency during chronic Mtb infection does not impact antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell number but maintains programmed death-1 (PD-1), CD69, and CD127 expression while reducing T-bet and killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) expression. Furthermore, T-bet haploinsufficiency results in failure to generate KLRG1(+), antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells, and in improved protection. T cells in Il27ra(-/-) mice accumulate preferentially in the lung parenchyma within close proximity to Mtb, and antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells lacking IL-27R are intrinsically more fit than intact T cells and maintain IL-2 production. Improved fitness of IL-27R-deficient T cells is not associated with increased proliferation but with decreased expression of cell death-associated markers. Therefore, during Mtb infection, IL-27R acts intrinsically on T cells to limit protection and reduce fitness, whereas the IL-27R-deficient environment alters the phenotype and location of T cells. The significant expression of IL-27 in TB and the negative influence of IL-27R on T cell function demonstrate the pathway by which this cytokine/receptor pair is detrimental in TB.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

A genomic comparison of the M. tuberculosis H37RV and M. bovis BCG identified 61 proteins that are unique to H37RV. Further screening of these 61 proteins using in silico analyses mimicking proteasomal digestion, transporter-associated antigen processing and H-2 antigen presentation identified 13 proteins with high densities of predicted MHC class I epitopes. Two native proteins, Rv1986c and Rv3875, were selected on the basis of their secreted or transmembrane characteristics and relatively lower frequencies of predicted MHC class II epitopes. To further enhance the CD8 T cell and TH1 responses, a hybrid protein, H32, was constructed by combining the nucleotide sequences encoding the MHC class I antigen-rich segment of Rv1986c and the entire Rv3875 sequence. The two native proteins and the hybrid were used to immunize C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice, which was followed by pulmonary instillation with irradiated M. tuberculosis H37RV. All three proteins elicited elevated IFN-gamma responses, with the hybrid showing significant increases over the native proteins in both mice. This strategy of immunogen selection might be used to improve the current subunit vaccines against M. tuberculosis as well as other intra-cellular pathogens. \textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently the liposome formulations are targeted to reduce toxicity and increase accumulation at the target site. There are several new methods of liposome preparation based on lipid drug interaction and liposome disposition mechanism including the inhibition of rapid clearance of liposome by controlling particle size, charge and surface hydration. Most clinical applications of liposomal drug delivery are targeting to tissue with or without expression of target recognition molecules on lipid membrane. The liposomes are characterized with respect to physical, chemical and biological parameters. The sizing of liposome is also critical parameter which helps characterize the liposome which is usually performed by sequential extrusion at relatively low pressure through polycarbonate membrane (PCM). This mode of drug delivery lends more safety and efficacy to administration of several classes of drugs like antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, vaccines, anti-tubercular drugs and gene therapeutics. Present applications of the liposomes are in the immunology, dermatology, vaccine adjuvant, eye disorders, brain targeting, infective disease and in tumour therapy. The new developments in this field are the specific binding properties of a drug-carrying liposome to a target cell such as a tumor cell and specific molecules in the body (antibodies, proteins, peptides etc.); stealth liposomes which are especially being used as carriers for hydrophilic (water soluble) anticancer drugs like doxorubicin, mitoxantrone; and bisphosphonate-liposome mediated depletion of macrophages. This review would be a help to the researchers working in the area of liposomal drug delivery. \textcopyright 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Maybe"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Maybe""}",,

In view of its zoonotic nature, slaughterhouse surveillance, potentially resulting in total or partial condemnation of the carcasses and organs, is conducted routinely. Spoligotyping, VNTR profiling, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of M. bovis isolated from tissues with tuberculosis-like lesions collected from 14 cattle at Eritrea's largest slaughterhouse in the capital Asmara, were conducted.The 14 M. bovis isolates were classified into three different spoligotype patterns (SB0120, SB0134 and SB0948) and six VNTR profiles. WGS results matched those of the conventional genotyping methods and further discriminated the six VNTR profiles into 14 strains. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the M. bovis isolates suggests two independent introductions of BTB into Eritrea possibly evolving from a common ancestral strain in Europe.This molecular study revealed the most important strains of M. bovis in Eritrea and their (dis)similarities with the strains generally present in East Africa and Europe, as well as potential routes of introduction of M. bovis. Though the sample size is small, the current study provides important information as well as platform for future in-depth molecular studies on isolates from both the dairy and the traditional livestock sectors in Eritrea and the region. This study provides information onthe origin of some of the M. bovis strains in Eritrea, its genetic diversity, evolution and patterns of spread between dairy herds.

Antibody-titres were quantified using ELISA and hemagglutination-inhibition test.Influenza-specific CD4 T-cells were recently activated CD45RO+/CD27+ Th1-cells. Specific T-cell frequencies significantly increased 1-2 weeks after the first vaccination in both controls (mean increase by 0.50+/-0.64%, max: 3.01%) and haemodialysis-patients (by 0.55+/-0.71%, max: 3.44%). Thereafter, T-cell levels continuously decreased to pre-vaccination levels within approximately 7 weeks, whereas antibody-titres were more stable overtime. By 6 months, haemodialysis-patients had significantly lower precursor-frequencies of proliferating influenza-specific memory T-cells (p = 0.006). In the following season, memory-maintenance in immunocompetent individuals led to a significantly less pronounced increase in cellular immunity after re-vaccination (by only 0.12+/-0.09%, p = 0.003), whereas the vaccine induced a strong increase in a second group of vaccination-naive controls. Of note, haemodialysis-patients responded like vaccination-naive individuals, as they showed a strong increase in cellular immunity after re-vaccination that was as pronounced as in the year before.In conclusion, the less pronounced T-cell increase after re-vaccination in controls may indicate maintenance of sufficient immunological memory. In contrast, the more rapid loss of proliferating cells in haemodialysis-patients may represent a sign of relative immunodeficiency and contribute to an increased incidence of recurrent infectious complications.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a central regulator of the immune defense against Mtb. Several cytokines have been shown to increase virulence of other bacterial pathogens, leading us to investigate whether IFN-gamma has a direct effect on Mtb. We found that both recombinant and T-cell derived IFN-gamma rapidly induced a dose-dependent increase in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of Mtb, consistent with increased bacterial respiration. This was also observed in clinical strains, but not in the vaccine strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and did not occur for other cytokines tested, including TNF-alpha. IFN-gamma binds to the cell surface of intact Mtb, but not BCG, whilst TNF-alpha binds to neither. Mass spectrometry analysis identified mycobacterial membrane protein large 10 (MmpL10) as the transmembrane binding partner. Consistent with this, IFN-gamma binding and the OCR response was absent in a Mtb DELTAmmpl10 strain and restored by complementation of the mutant strain. RNA-sequencing of IFN-gamma exposed Mtb revealed a distinct transcriptional profile, including genes involved in virulence and cholesterol catabolism. Finally, exposure of Mtb cells to IFN-gamma resulted in sterilization of bacilli treated with isoniazid (INH), indicating clearance of phenotypically resistant bacteria that persist in the presence of INH alone. Our data suggest a novel mechanism allowing Mtb to respond to host immune activation that may be important in the immunopathogenesis of TB and have use in novel eradication strategies.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

J. and Logan, K. E. and Ferraz, J. C. and Hewinson, R. G. and Chambers, M. A.",,,,,"Tuberculosis caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. bovis remains one of the most important infectious diseases of man and animals, and continues to inflict a huge cost in both health and financial terms. The current vaccine, BCG demonstrates variable efficacy and so a more robust vaccine strategy to either replace or supplement BCG is required. We have utilised a DNA prime-BCG boost strategy in a murine M. bovis challenge model using a cocktail of 3 DNA vaccines (encoding Hsp65, Hsp70 and Apa) followed by BCG. Controls were inoculated with vector DNA only, coding DNA only, BCG only or vector DNA followed by BCG boost. Analysis of immune responses by ELISpot prior to challenge, revealed that the coding DNA/BCG prime boost resulted in an increased frequency of antigen-specific IFNgamma producing cells compared to the other regimes. When spleen cell cytokine production to BCG antigens was analysed, significantly more IFNgamma and IL-12 was seen in those groups primed with DNA (coding or vector) prior to BCG than those receiving BCG alone. Analysis of bacterial counts revealed that DNA priming followed by BCG boost further improved the protective immunity induced by BCG alone. Surprisingly, inoculation with vector DNA was as efficacious as the coding DNA in enhancing BCG protection. Taken together these results indicate that whilst the coding DNA vaccines induce antigen specific responses, treatment with the vector DNA is sufficient for the increase in protective immunity over that induced by BCG, suggesting that the vector DNA may be acting as a non-specific adjuvant for BCG immunization.

Most of the viral and bacterial infections that traditionally affected children have been drastically reduced thanks to national immunization programs in developed countries. However, many diseases are not yet preventable by vaccination, and vaccines have not been fully exploited for target populations such as elderly and pregnant women. This review focuses on the state of the art of recent clinical trials of vaccines for major unmet medical needs such as HIV, malaria, TB, and cancer. In addition, we describe the innovative technologies currently used in vaccine research and development including adjuvants, vectors, nucleic acid vaccines, and structure-based antigen design. The hope is that thanks to these technologies, more diseases will be addressed in the 21st century by novel preventative and therapeutic vaccines.

Spray dried powders containing these two vaccines display the morphologic and chemical properties desired for long-term thermostability and vaccination. Upon reconstitution, they effectively transfected the cells in vitro with relatively small losses in viral infectivity related to the spray drying process. Following in vivo vaccination, AdHu5- and AdCh68-vectored vaccines were as immunogenic as the conventional fresh, cryopreserved liquid vaccine samples. Of importance, even after cold chain-free storage, at ambient temperatures and relatively low humidity for 30 and 90 days, the vaccines retained their in vivo immunogenicity, while the liquid vaccine samples stored under the same conditions lost their immune-activating capability almost entirely.

Here, the authors present a description of the variability in gene expression patterns among ten clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, plus the laboratory strains H37Rv and H37Ra, growing in liquid culture. They identified 527 genes (15% of those tested) that are variably expressed among the isolates studied. The remaining genes were divided into three categories based on their expression levels: unexpressed (38%), low to undetectable expression (31%) and consistently expressed (16%). The expression categories were compared with functional categories and three biologically interesting gene lists: genes that are deleted among clinical isolates, T-cell antigens and essential genes. There were significant associations between expression variability and the classification of genes as T-cell antigens, involved in lipid metabolism, PE/PPE, insertion sequences and phages, and deleted among clinical isolates. This survey of mRNA expression among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis demonstrates that genes with important functions can vary in their expression levels between strains grown under identical conditions. \textcopyright 2005 SGM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

A. and Athar, F.",,,,,"The authors are currently dealing with the highest incidence of tuberculosis, where every third person in the world is experiencing the latent condition of the disease. The affected ratio is not limited to any age group, and therefore, the development of new drug or vaccine is the need of the hour. The use of medicinal plants in curing disease is a novel and significant area of interest. The PE\_PGRS 16 has putative aspartic proteinase domain, which reveals the characteristic of pepsin-fold and is recognized as a surface antigen; therefore, it would be an important target for drug design. The structure of PE\_PGRS 16 was obtained from PDB databank and the phytocompounds of Calotropis procera were obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. PyRx tool and AutoDock Vina were used to prepared dock file and docking analysis, respectively. The compounds were selected based on docking score, and selected compounds were further checked by absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties to conclude a list of safe and effective drugs. Visualization and analysis of interaction was done by Discovery Studio Visualizer. Screened phytocompounds against the PE\_PGRS 16 accurately fitted within the active sites. The structural analysis suggested the binding to residues Asp46, Thr47, and Gly48 short sequence motif D(T/S)G 1, Asp199, Ser200, and Gly201 D(T/S)G 2 with the compound. These residues are important for protein activity, and therefore, drug binding at these residues may hamper protein's activity. l-rhamnose and ferulic acid closely interacted with active site residue of PE\_PGRS 16, and therefore, it is hypothesized that these compounds are the putative target of the protein activity, which enhance bacterial pathogenesis and survival.Copyright \textcopyright 2021 The Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

F. and Fallah, J. and Thomson, C. and Fabre, V. and Minami, T.",,,,,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Maintain a high clinical suspicion for tuberculosis in this vulnerable population. CASE: Introduction: Despite advances in therapy, tuberculosis represents a major burden of disease worldwide with 9 million cases and 1.5 million deaths annually. Laryngeal tuberculosis, once a common presentation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, has become increasingly rare since the advent of effective antitubercular therapy. The following describes a case of laryngeal tuberculosis presenting as acute epiglottitis. Case report: A 48-year-old man with a history of binge drinking and a positive PPD 20 years prior presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening sore throat, dysphagia and hoarseness for 1 week. Review of systems revealed a 15-lb weight loss and productive cough over the previous 6 months. He migrated to the United States from Guatemala 22 years prior to presentation and denied any exposure to tuberculosis. Physical examination was remarkable for hoarseness and oropharyngeal thrush. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed epiglottitis and CT of the chest showed a large cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed supraglottic edema as well as granular, superficial ulceration on the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. Laboratory findings were remarkable for a lymphocyte count of 300 cells/mul. Anti-HIV antibody, respiratory viral panel, legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigens, and blood cultures were negative. Sputum samples showed numerous acid fast bacilli and nucleic acid testing confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. His oropharyngeal symptoms improved with fluconazole and dexamethasone. He was started on isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for laryngeal and pulmonary tuberculosis and was eventually discharged home with isolation precautions after coordination with the State Department of Health. DISCUSSION: Discussion: Laryngeal tuberculosis (LT) is an increasingly rare manifestation of tuberculosis, now seen in only 1 % of cases. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, particularly in US natives or migrants who have resided in the US for a long time, as LT is frequently confused with laryngeal carcinoma in these populations. On laryngoscopy, lesions vary in both appearance and location, and may appear ulcerative, ulcerofungative, or polypoid. While LT is typically associated with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, as seen in our case, up to 20% of LT cases present as primary disease. Typically LT presents in men in their forties or fifties and the most frequent complaints are dysphonia and weight loss. Risk factors include lack of prior vaccination with BCG, tobacco or alcohol use, acquired immunosuppression or malnutrition. Our patient serves as a reminder to maintain a high clinical suspicion for tuberculosis in this vulnerable population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Today's chemotherapy is lengthy as well as ineffective to control tuberculosis. Moreover, in the absence of fundamental biological understanding of mycobacterial persistence, significant pathogen driven factors and validated animal models, shortening the duration of anti-tuberculosis therapy remains a distant goal. Subsequently, molecular signaling proteins which serve as potential targets should be explored and explicated to limit mycobacterial growth. This review focuses on mechanisms of mycobacterial persistence, various models of latent tuberculosis, identification of crucial gene targets, vaccination and therapeutic approaches to target latent tuberculosis infection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Maybe"", ""R2""=>""Included"", ""R3""=>""Included"", ""R4""=>""Maybe""}",,

Inadequacies of the available diagnostic tests for tuberculosis have contributed to both under and overdiagnosis of the disease and have driven the zeal for development of new effective point of care diagnostic tools. The paucibacillary and extra-pulmonary disease among children makes the diagnosis more challenging. The current strategy is to look for novel approaches while also working for improvement in the existing diagnostics. Among the tools developed so far, those likely to have major impact on diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis include: better specimen collection and processing techniques, improvement in microscopy and newer culture methods. Most relevant application of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) appeared to be for rapid detection of mutations associated with drug resistance. And, the recently developed Xpert MTB/RIF®system holds promise as a rapid, point of care diagnostic for childhood tuberculosis. Development of Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) in place of Tuberculin skin test (TST) has not led to any better diagnosis of disease though these tests are more specific and not affected by BCG vaccination. Skin test with recombinant dimer ESAT-6 (rdESAT-6), urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assay and test for volatile organic compounds produced by mycobacteria in breath are newer promises in the diagnostics pipeline that seem attractive and need further evaluation in pediatric population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Six weeks after aerosol immunization with recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin overexpressing the 30-kDa antigen, C3HeB/FeJ mice were aerosol infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Six weeks Later, mice were treated with one of three standard regimens for latent tuberculosis infection or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) neutralizing antibody. Mouse Lungs were analyzed by histological features, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, whole-genome microarrays, and RT-PCR. Lungs and sera were studied by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Paucibacillary infection was established, recapitulating the sterilizing activities of human latent tuberculosis infection regimens. TNF neutralization led to increased lung bacillary Load, disrupted granuloma architecture with expanded necrotic foci and reduced tissue hypoxia, and accelerated animal mortality. TNF-neutralized mouse Lungs and sera showed significant up-regulation of interferon gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, chemokine ligands 2 and 3, and matrix metalloproteinase genes. Clinical and microbiological reactivation of paucibaciaary infection by TNF neutralization was associated with reduced hypoxia in Lung granulomas and induction of matrix metalloproteinases and proinfLammatory cytokines. This model may be useful for screening the sterilizing activity of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, and identifying mycobacterial regulatory and metabolic pathways required for bacillary growth restriction and reactivation.

We have constructed a DELTARD1DELTApanCD mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mc26030) that undergoes limited replication and is severely attenuated in immunocompromised mice, yet induces significant protection against tuberculosis in wild-type mice and even in mice that completely lack CD4 + T cells as a result of targeted disruption of their CD4 genes (CD4-/- mice). Ex vivo studies of T cells from mc26030- immunized mice showed that these immune cells responded to protein antigens of M. tuberculosis in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted manner. Antibody depletion experiments showed that antituberculosis protective responses in the lung were not diminished by removal of CD8+, T-cell receptor gammadelta (TCR-gammadelta+) and NK1.1+ T cells from vaccinated CD4-/- mice before challenge, implying that the observed recall and immune effector functions resulting from vaccination of CD4-/- mice with mc26030 were attributable to a population of CD4- CD8- (double-negative) TCR- alphabeta+, TCR-gammadelta-, NK1.1- T cells. Transfer of highly enriched double-negative TCR-alphabeta+ T cells from mc26030-immunized CD4-/- mice into naive CD4-/- mice resulted in significant protection against an aerosol tuberculosis challenge. Enriched pulmonary double-negative T cells transcribed significantly more interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 mRNA than double-negative T cells from naive mice after a tuberculous challenge. These results confirmed previous findings on the potential for a subset of MHC class II-restricted T cells to develop and function without expression of CD4 and suggest novel vaccination strategies to assist in the control of tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected humans who have chronic depletion of their CD4+ T cells. \textcopyright 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Cell-mediated immunity (Th1 and Th2 responses) and humoral immunity can be obtained. B-cell production of antibodies is generally weaker than induced by traditional vaccines. Various approaches to boost the immune response have been studied, including co-administration of cytokines, co-stimulation with specific genes, and addition of targeting molecules. Research with animal models has shown that DNA vaccines are safe. Deleterious immune responses, such as autoimmunity and development of tolerance in response to persistent expression of a foreign antigen, have not been observed. Phase I and Phase II clinical trials with DNA vaccines have been conducted for HIV, HBV, HVC, HSV, tuberculosis, and malaria.

rayyan-818449952,Biologic and novel therapy of the inflammatory bowel diseases,2005,,,,,4,3,,"Makrauer, F. L. and Burakoff, R.",,,,,"IBD is now best considered as a group of genetic disorders of immune dysregulation with failure of down-regulation of the intestinal mucosa's normal immune response to its intraluminal commensal bacterial milieu combined with inappropriate migration of antigenic material triggered by multiple host (appendectomy, pregnancy, breast feeding, age) and environmental factors (tobacco smoking, birth control pill, NSAIDS). The result is the predominance of an effector or pro-inflammatory cytokine response due to clonal expansion of T1 and T2 helper lymphocytes (Th1 and Th2 response) combined with an inadequate regulatory cytokine response by T3 helper (Th3) and T1 regulatory (Tr1) lymphocytes. The persistence of this imbalance in the inflammatory response then leads to tissue damage resulting in both local and systemic illness. In human IBD, a distinction can now be drawn between Crohn's disease with its Th1 effector response characterized by high levels of the cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) leading to transmural inflammation with granulomas, and ulcerative colitis with a Th2 effector response, high levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-13 (IL-13) characterized by strictly mucosal inflammation. The difficulty with adherence to current maintenance therapy for the inflammatory bowel diseases as well as the toxicity and relative ineffectiveness of induction therapy has provided the impetus for the development of new biologic and novel therapies which will be reviewed in this article. Biologic therapy has been divided into five areas of study: 1) native biologic preparations and isolates such as vaccines, hormone fragments and blood products, 2) recombinant peptides or proteins, including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, 3) monoclonal antibody-based therapies, 4) anti-sense nucleotides to nucleic acids, and 5) cell and gene therapies. Since the early 1990's, investigation in all five of these areas has yielded numerous potential agents for use in treating IBD more effectively and safely. While only one, infliximab (Remicade), is FDA-approved, several additional agents should be available for clinical use in the near future with the promise of more to follow. Our discussion of biologic and novel therapies represents a review of the most promising treatments and a status report of on-going clinical trials. Peripheral leukocyte apheresis and stem cell transplants, while suggesting an exciting new pathway for investigation, will not be reviewed. Our discussion is organized by each agent's hypothesized mode of intervention in altering the pathogenesis of IBD. \textcopyright 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

The majority of patients harbor the bacterium in a state of metabolic dormancy. New drugs with novel modes of action are needed to target essential metabolic pathways in M. tuberculosis; ATP-competitive enzyme inhibitors are one such class. Previous screening efforts for ATP-competitive enzyme inhibitors identified several classes of lead compounds that demonstrated potent anti-mycobacterial efficacy as well as tolerable levels of toxicity in cell culture. In this report, a probe-based chemoproteomic approach was used to selectively profile the M. tuberculosis ATP-binding proteome in normally growing and hypoxic M. tuberculosis. From these studies, 122 ATP-binding proteins were identified in either metabolic state, and roughly 60% of these are reported to be essential for survival in vitro. These data are available through ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000141. Protein families vital to the survival of the tubercle bacillus during hypoxia emerged from our studies. Specifically, along with members of the DosR regulon, several proteins involved in energy metabolism (Icl/Rv0468 and Mdh/ Rv1240) and lipid biosynthesis (UmaA/Rv0469, DesA1/ Rv0824c, and DesA2/Rv1094) were found to be differentially abundant in hypoxic versus normal growing cultures.

Using ELISA, IFN-gamma production was found to be significantly depressed, while IL-10 was significantly elevated in both MDR-TB and EAPTB after in vitro stimulation with PPD, compared with those in HTR. Although there was no significant difference in IL-12 production among the three groups, mean IL-12 production was highest in patients with MDR-TB. In these patients, IL-12 production was significantly correlated with IL-10 expression, but not IFN-gamma production. In addition, neutralization of endogenous IL-10 led to enhanced IFN-gamma and IL-12Rbeta2 mRNA expression in TB patients. Our findings suggest that both groups of TB patients may have a similar disregulated pattern of IL-12, IL-10, and IFN-gamma production during M. tuberculosis infection.

We sought to quantify the consequences of Ebola virus disease on maternal and child health services in the highly-affected Forest region of Guinea.Methods We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of women and children attending public health facilities for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and immunisation services in six of seven health districts in the Forest region (Beyla, Guckdou, Kissidougou, Lola, Macenta, and N'Zerekore). We examined monthly service use data for eight maternal and child health services indicators: antenatal care (>= 1 antenatal care visit and >= 3 antenatal care visits), institutional delivery, and receipt of five infant vaccines: polio, pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B virus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b), yellow fever, measles, and tuberculosis. We used interrupted time series models to estimate trends in each indicator across three time periods: pre-Ebola virus disease epidemic (January, 2013, to February, 2014), during-epidemic (March, 2014, to February, 2015) and postepidemic (March, 2015, to Feb, 2016). We used segmented ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression using NeweyWest standard errors to accommodate for serial autocorrelation, and adjusted for any potential effect of birth seasonality on our outcomes.Findings In the months before the Ebola virus disease outbreak, all three maternal indicators showed a significantly positive change in trend, ranging from a monthly average increase of 61 (95% CI 38-84) institutional deliveries to 119 (95% CI 79-158) women achieving at least three antenatal care visits. These increasing trends were reversed during the epidemic: fewer institutional deliveries occurred (-240, 95% CI -293 to -187), and fewer women achieved at least one antenatal care visit (-418, 95% CI -535 to -300) or at least three antenatal care visits (-363, 95% CI -485 to -242) per month (p< 0.0001 for all). Compared with the negative trend during the outbreak, the change in trend during the post-outbreak period showed that 173 more women per month (95% CI 51-294; p= 0.0074) had at least one antenatal care visit, 257 more (95% CI 117-398; p= 0.0010) had at least three antenatal care visits and 149 more (95% CI 91-206; p< 0.0001) had institutional deliveries. However, although the numbers for these indicators increased in the post-epidemic period, the trends for all stagnated. Similarly, the increasing trend in child vaccination completion during the pre-epidemic period was followed by significant immediate and trend reductions across most vaccine types. Before the outbreak, the number of children younger than 12 months who had completed each vaccination ranged from 5752 (95% CI 2821-8682) for tuberculosis to 8043 (95% CI 7621-8464) for yellow fever. Immediately after the outbreak, significant reductions occurred in the level of all vaccinations except for yellow fever for which the reduction was marginal. The greatest reductions were noted for polio and tuberculosis at -3594 (95% CI -4811 to -2377; p< 0.0001) and -3048 (95% CI -5879 to -216; p= 0.0362) fewer vaccines administered, respectively. Compared with pre-Ebola virus disease outbreak trends, significant decreases occurred for all vaccines except polio, with the trend of monthly decreases in the number of children vaccinated ranging from -419 (95% CI -683 to -155; p= 0.0034) fewer for BCG to -313 (95% CI-446 to -179; p< 0.0001) fewer for pentavalent during the outbreak. In the post-Ebola virus disease outbreak period, vaccination coverage for polio, measles, and yellow fever continued to decrease, whereas the trend in coverage for tuberculosis and pentavalent did not significantly differ from zero.Interpretation Most maternal and child health indicators significantly declined during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014. Despite a reduction in this negative trend in the post-outbreak period, the use of essential maternal and child health services have not recovered to their pre-outbreak levels, nor are they all on a course that suggests that they will recover without targeted interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Improving accessibility through the creation of functional continent-wide networks, building multipathogen sequencing cores, training a critical mass of local experts, development of standards and policies to facilitate best practices for data sharing, and establishing a community of practice of genomics experts are all needed to use genomics for improved disease surveillance in Africa.

Method and Results: Guinea pigs were vaccinated with five different formulations of oral BCG.

Host RNA was isolated and amplified following antigenic restimulation of PBMCs for 24 h with 30 mu g of bovine PPD. The up- or down-regulation of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), a key cytokine involved in protection against tuberculosis, was assessed using real-time PCR. The relative expression of prechallenge IFN-gamma mRNA in the vaccinated groups (n = 5) correlated (P < 0.001) with protection against M. bovis challenge. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that it is possible to take blood samples and track IFN-gamma responses in guinea pigs that then go on to be exposed to M. bovis, thus providing prechallenge vaccine uptake information.

The recombinant BCG DELTAureC::hly (rBCG) vaccine candidate induces improved protection against tuberculosis over parental BCG (pBCG) in preclinical studies and has successfully completed a phase 2a clinical trial. However, the mechanisms responsible for the superior vaccine efficacy of rBCG are still incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the underlying biological mechanisms elicited by the rBCG vaccine candidate relevant to its protective efficacy. Methods. THP-1 macrophages were infected with pBCG or rBCG, and inflammasome activation and autophagy were evaluated. In addition, mice were vaccinated with pBCG or rBCG, and gene expression in the draining lymph nodes was analyzed by microarray at day 1 after vaccination. Results. BCG-derived DNA was detected in the cytosol of rBCG-infected macrophages. rBCG infection was associated with enhanced absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation, increased activation of caspases and production of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18, as well as induction of AIM2-dependent and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent autophagy. Similarly, mice vaccinated with rBCG showed early increased expression of Il-1beta, Il-18, and Tmem173 (transmembrane protein 173; also known as STING). Conclusions. rBCG stimulates AIM2 inflammasome activation and autophagy, suggesting that these cell-autonomous functions should be exploited for improved vaccine design.Copyright \textcopyright 2014 The Author 2014.

It is now well established that oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing cytidine phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs enhance cell-mediated responses in vivo by increasing the production of the TH1 cytokines IL-12 and interferon gamma (IFNgamma). To determine if this would improve subunit vaccination of mice CpG ODN were added to a subunit vaccine consisting of the culture filtrate proteins (CFP) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. It was observed that although adding CpG ODN to the vaccines promoted substantially increased IFNgamma production by lymph node cells draining sites of inoculation, this failed to translate after aerosol challenge into any degree of enhancement of bacterial clearance in the lungs, influx of IFN-positive T cells, or changes in histopathology. These data suggest that the vaccine enhancing effects of CpG ODN are relatively transient.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Methods The 2011 Seroprevalence and Behavioral Epidemiology Risk Survey for HIV and STIs collected biologic specimens with demographic and behavioral data from a representative sample of Guyana military personnel. Diagnostics included commercial serum: HIV antibody; total antibody to hepatitis B core (anti-HBc); IgM anti-HBc; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); anti-HBs; antibody to HCV with confirmatory testing; and HBV DNA sequencing with S gene fragment phylogenetic analysis. Chi-square, p-values and prevalence ratios determined statistical significance. Results Among 480 participants providing serologic specimens, 176 (36.7%) tested anti-HBc-positive. Overall, 19 (4.0%) participants tested HBsAg-positive; 17 (89.5%) of the HBsAg-positive participants also had detectable anti-HBc, including 1 (5.3%) IgM anti-HBc-positive male. Four (6.8%) females with available HBV testing were HBsAg-positive, all aged 23-29 years. Sixteen (16, 84.2%) HBsAg-positive participants had sufficient specimen for DNA testing. All 16 had detectable HBV DNA, 4 with viral load >2x104IU/ml. Sequencing found: 12 genotype (gt) A1 with 99.9% genetic identity between 1 IgM anti-HBc-positive and 1 anti-HBc-negative; 2 gtD1; and 2 with insufficient specimen. No statistically significant associations between risk factors and HBV infection were identified. Conclusions Integrated HIV surveillance identified likely recent adult HBV transmission, current HBV infection among females of reproductive age, moderate HBV infection prevalence (all gtA1 and D1), no HCV infections and low HIV frequency among Guyana military personnel. Integrated HIV surveillance helped characterize HBV and HCV epidemiology, including probable recent transmission, prompting targeted responses to control ongoing HBV transmission and examination of hepatitis B vaccine policies.Copyright This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

We found that infection of human neutrophils with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induced rapid cell death displaying the characteristic features of apoptosis such as morphologic changes, phosphatidylserine exposure, and DNA fragmentation. Both a virulent (H37Rv) and an attenuated (H37Ra) strain of Mtb were equally effective in inducing apoptosis. Pretreatment of neutrophils with antioxidants or an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase markedly blocked Mtb-induced apoptosis but did not affect spontaneous apoptosis. Activation of caspase-3 was evident in neutrophils undergoing spontaneous apoptosis, but it was markedly augmented and accelerated during Mtb-induced apoptosis. The Mtb-induced apoptosis was associated with a speedy and transient increase in expression of Bax protein, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and a more prominent reduction in expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x(L). Pretreatment with an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase distinctly suppressed the Mtb-stimulated activation of caspase-3 and alteration of Bax/Bcl-x(L) expression in neutrophils. These results indicate that infection with Mtb causes ROS-dependent alteration of Bax/Bcl-x(L) expression and activation of caspase-3, and thereby induces apoptosis in human neutrophils. Moreover, we found that phagocytosis of Mtb-induced apoptotic neutrophils markedly increased the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha by human macrophages. Therefore, the ROS-dependent apoptosis in Mtb-stimulated neutrophils may represent an important host defense mechanism aimed at selective removal of infected cells at the inflamed site, which in turn aids the functional activities of local macrophages.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

We find that immunotherapy via the respiratory mucosal, but not parenteral, route significantly accelerates pulmonary mycobacterial clearance, limits lung pathology, and restricts disease rebound after premature antibiotic cessation. We further show that vaccine-activated antigen-specific T cells, particularly CD8 T cells, in the lung play an important role in immunotherapeutic effects.Conclusions. Our results indicate that a single-dose respiratory mucosal immunotherapy with AdCh68Ag85A adjunct to antibiotic therapy has the potential to significantly accelerate disease control and shorten the duration of conventional treatment.

Various studies have shown that chitosan, a natural polymer, can serve as a potent carrier for the delivery of various hydrophilic molecules such as peptide, protein and drug agents due to some of its excellent characteristics including low toxicity, biodegradable and biocompatible properties and stability. Currently, these polysaccharide polymers have gained more attention as candidates for the adjuvant/delivery of anti-TB vaccines due to better cellular uptake, muco-adhesive characteristics, prolonged control release, persistent stimulation of the immune system, more efficient uptake by antigen processing cells (APCs), adjuvant/immunopotentiator function, and preventing antigen degradation in-vivo. The present study showed that the new generation of TB vaccine candidates when used in combination with chitosan and its derivatives as adjuvant or delivery system, could potently induce both protective and cell-mediated (CD4 and CD8) immune responses in animal models. In addition, they could also enhance protection against Mtb infection in TB-challenged mice and act as booster-vaccines to improve BCG-primed immunity and excellent prime-vaccines. The results of this study showed that parenteral and non-parenteral immunization of chitosan-based TB vaccines can induce appropriate immune responses; however, we suggest that based on some advantages of chitosan polymers and mucosal delivery route, non-parenteral immunization may be a better administration route for chitosan-based TB vaccines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Maybe"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, interacts with CD80/CD86, thereby limiting T-cell activation and leading to anergy. PD-1 is predominantly expressed on T cells and its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and tumors sends a negative signal to T cells, which can lead to T-cell exhaustion. Given their role in suppressing effector T-cell responses, immune checkpoints are being targeted for the treatment of cancer. Indeed, antibodies binding to CTLA-4, PD1, or PD-L1 have shown remarkable efficacy, especially in combination therapies, for a number of cancers and have been licensed for the treatment of melanoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and renal and bladder cancers.

The homoplastic SNPs in ppe18 were particularly common among M. tuberculosis Lineage 1 isolates, suggesting the need for caution in extrapolating the results of the vaccine trial to the population where L1 is endemic in Asia. As expected, homoplastic SNPs strongly associated with drug resistance. Most of these mutations are already well known.

Recently, Mtb-secreted proteins have been considered virulence factors and candidates for drugs and vaccines. Among these proteins, 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) is known to be able to induce component of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in epithelial cells, leading to recruitment of macrophages. However, detailed function of ESAT-6 during macrophage recruitment to inflammatory sites remains unknown. Thus, the objective of the present study was to elucidate such function of EAST-6 and mechanism(s) involved. In the present study, we have found that recombinant ESAT-6 purified in the form of ESAT-6 double-connected structure (2E6D) could inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced potential of cell migration and inflammation in murine macrophage cells. Interestingly, 2E6D suppressed LPS-induced MMP-9 expression at both protein and mRNA levels as well as its enzyme activity. Levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzymes as known upregulators of MMP-9 were significantly decreased when 2E6D has been treated. In addition, nitric oxide (NO) as a second messenger was also significantly decreased by treatment with the purified 2E6D.

Louise M.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008107,,,,"Author summary Zika virus (ZIKV) is primarily maintained in an enzootic cycle involving nonhuman primates and mosquitoes, with epizootics and epidemics occurring when the virus is introduced into naive populations of nonhuman primates or humans, respectively. While, the primary transmission mechanism of the virus is by the bite on an infected mosquito, ZIKV can also be sexually transmitted. In an effort to develop novel animal models to study ZIKV disease, and to better understand the role of nonhuman primates as amplification and maintenance hosts of ZIKV in nature, we modeled mosquito-borne and sexual transmission of ZIKV in the enzootic host, the African green monkey (AGM). Infection dynamics and neutralizing antibody responses in all three AGM ZIKV models (subcutaneous, intravaginal and intrarectal) in the absence of clinical illness-recapitulated reported generalized human disease course. Furthermore, we detected prolonged shedding with high viral loads and infectious virus in the vaginal swabs collected from an infected female AGM inoculated intrarectally. Notably, these results support limited human clinical evidence that ZIKV transmission can occur during female-to-male vaginal sexual acts, and furthermore indicate the existence of ZIKV super-spreaders. Finally, our results indicate sexual transmission of ZIKV could occur among infected nonhuman primates (e.g.Chlorocebusspp.) in Africa and may serve as a secondary transmission and maintenance mechanism in the absence of mosquito-to-nonhuman primate transmission.Mosquito-borne and sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV), a TORCH pathogen, recently initiated a series of large epidemics throughout the Tropics. Animal models are necessary to determine transmission risk and study pathogenesis, as well screen antivirals and vaccine candidates. In this study, we modeled mosquito and sexual transmission of ZIKV in the African green monkey (AGM). Following subcutaneous, intravaginal or intrarectal inoculation of AGMs with ZIKV, we determined the transmission potential and infection dynamics of the virus. AGMs inoculated by all three transmission routes exhibited viremia and viral shedding followed by strong virus neutralizing antibody responses, in the absence of clinical illness. All four of the subcutaneously inoculated AGMs became infected (mean peak viremia: 2.9 log(10)PFU/mL, mean duration: 4.3 days) and vRNA was detected in their oral swabs, with infectious virus being detected in a subset of these specimens. Although all four of the intravaginally inoculated AGMs developed virus neutralizing antibody responses, only three had detectable viremia (mean peak viremia: 4.0 log(10)PFU/mL, mean duration: 3.0 days). These three AGMs also had vRNA and infectious virus detected in both oral and vaginal swabs. Two of the four intrarectally inoculated AGMs became infected (mean peak viremia: 3.8 log(10)PFU/mL, mean duration: 3.5 days). vRNA was detected in oral swabs collected from both of these infected AGMs, and infectious virus was detected in an oral swab from one of these AGMs. Notably, vRNA and infectious virus were detected in vaginal swabs collected from the infected female AGM (peak viral load: 7.5 log(10)copies/mL, peak titer: 3.8 log(10)PFU/mL, range of detection: 5-21 days post infection). Abnormal clinical chemistry and hematology results were detected and acute lymphadenopathy was observed in some AGMs. Infection dynamics in all three AGM ZIKV models are similar to those reported in the majority of human ZIKV infections. Our results indicate that the AGM can be used as a surrogate to model mosquito or sexual ZIKV transmission and infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that AGMs are likely involved in the enzootic maintenance and amplification cycle of ZIKV.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

L.",http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/66/Supplement_1/A478.full-text.pdf,,,,"Increasing the potency or numbers of active regulatory T cells (Tregs) is a goal of many clinical trials seeking to halt autoimmunity. In a published study, BCG-treated subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) had statistically significant increases in Treg numbers for 4-6 weeks after repeat BCG vaccination. A longer-lasting effect would be optimal and may be able to stably reverse diabetic autoreactivity. Chronic Mycobacteria infections evade host recognition on a cellular level via measurable Treg increases and induction of host Tregs. For BCG's virulent counterpart, tuberculosis, epigenetic imprinting of host genes is a mechanism for host Treg production and infection chronicity. We therefore investigated if the effect of repeat BCG vaccinations on Tregs could be permanent and driven by host epigenetic modifications to Treg signature genes. BCG's impact on methylation was studied at methylation sites on 6 Treg signature genes (FoxP3, TNFRSF18, IL2RA, IKZF2, IKZF4, CTLA4) by profiling transcriptional start site (TSS) clusters located within the Treg-specific demethylation region in T1D subjects before and 8-weeks after in vivo BCG dosing. BCG induced demethylation at almost all TSS in all 6 signature genes. In vivo documented epigenetic changes correlated with increased mRNA expression of all 6 Treg signature genes in isolated CD4 T cells. Overall, repeat BCG vaccinations reset the immune system by consistent and rapid demethylation of all 6 key Treg genes for enhanced mRNA expression, as monitored via CD4 T cells in blood from BCG-treated T1D subjects. This suggests that not only are Treg cell numbers transiently elevated after BCG vaccination, but also that permanent epigenetic expression of Treg genes that control Treg potency is stably re-established by BCG treatment. BCG vaccination, like tuberculosis, powerfully modulates Treg induction. Studies are underway to follow vaccinated T1D subjects for longterm beneficial clinical effects of Treg upregulation by BCG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

Apart from the recent advances in the design and selection of improved epitopes and adjuvants, there are also ongoing efforts to optimize delivery platforms. Viral vectors are the best-characterized delivery tools because of their intrinsic adjuvant capability, unique cellular tropism, and ability to trigger robust adaptive immune responses. However, a known limitation of viral vectors is preexisting immunity, and ongoing efforts are aimed at developing novel vector platforms with lower seroprevalence. It is also becoming increasingly clear that different vectors, even those derived from phylogenetically similar viruses, can elicit substantially distinct immune responses, in terms of quantity, quality, and location, which can ultimately affect immune protection.

The study outcome was LTBI (positive IGRA test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube or T-SPOT.TB)). The main exposures were history of smoking, history of substance misuse, homelessness, prison stay and socioeconomic deprivation. Results 4914 (56.2%) individuals resided in the most deprived areas and 2536 (27.6%) had LTBI. In the multivariable analysis (adjusting for age, gender, place of birth, ethnicity, HIV status, BCG vaccination and recent TB contact) living in the least deprived areas compared with living in the most deprived areas was associated with reduced odds of LTBI (odds ratio (OR)=0.68, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.90) while ever been homeless (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.21) was associated with increased odds of LTBI.

The early, accurate diagnosis of pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and timely medication are associated with better prognosis. Conventional methods, such as culture, microscopic examination, serological detection, CSF routine analysis, and radiological findings, either are time-consuming or lack sensitivity and specificity. Methods To address these clinical needs, we developed an advanced fragment analysis (AFA)-based assay for the multiplex detection of 22 common ME pathogens, including eight viruses, 11 bacteria, and three fungi. The detection sensitivity of each target was evaluated with a recombinant plasmid. The limits of detection of the 22 pathogens ranged from 15 to 120 copies/reaction. We performed a retrospective study to analyze the pathogens from the CSF specimens of 170 clinically diagnosed ME patients using an AFA-based assay and compared the results with culture (bacteria and fungi), microscopic examination (fungi), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and Sanger sequencing (virus) results. Results The sensitivity of the AFA assay was 100% for 10 analytes. For Cryptococcus neoformans, the sensitivity was 63.6%. The overall specificity was 98.2%. The turnaround time was reduced to 4-6 hours from the 3-7 days required using conventional methods.

However, because of incomplete reference resources, the coverage and accuracy of the traditional targeted amplification strategies for profiling rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires are largely unknown. In this study, using long read sequencing, we sequenced four Indian-origin rhesus macaque tissues and obtained high-quality, full-length sequences for over 6000 unique Ig and TCR transcripts, without the need for sequence assembly. We constructed, to our knowledge, the first complete reference set for the constant regions of all known isotypes and chain types of rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires. We show that sequence diversity exists across the entire variable regions of rhesus Ig and TCR transcripts. Consequently, existing strategies using targeted amplification of rearranged variable regions comprised of V(D)J gene segments miss a significant fraction (27-53% and 42-49%) of rhesus Ig/TCR diversity. To overcome these limitations, we designed new rhesus-specific assays that remove the need for primers conventionally targeting variable regions and allow single cell level Ig and TCR repertoire analysis.

According to the International Health Regulations, many countries require yellow fever vaccination and proof thereof as the International Certificate of vaccination. Additionally selected countries require proof of vaccination against cholera and meningococcal disease. A consultation for travel health advice is always an opportunity to ascertain that routine immunizations have been performed. Recommended immunizations often are more important for traveller's health than the required or routine ones. The most frequent vaccine preventable infection in non-immune travellers to developing countries is hepatitis A with an average incidence rate of 0.3%, per month; in high risk backpackers or foreign-aid-volunteers this rate is 2.0%. Many immunizations are recommended for special risk groups only: there is a growing tendency in many countries to immunize all young travellers to developing countries against hepatitis B, as it is uncertain who will voluntarily or involuntarily get exposed. The attack rate of influenza in intercontinental travel is estimated to be 1%. Immunity against poliomyelitis remains essential for travel to Africa and parts of Asia. Many of the 0.2-0.4% who experience an animal bite are at risk of rabies. Typhoid fever is diagnosed with an incidence rate of 0.03% per month among travellers to the Indian subcontinent, North and West Africa (except Tunisia), and Peru, elsewhere this rate is 10-fold lower. Meningococcal disease, Japanese encephalitis, cholera and tuberculosis have been reported in travellers, but these infections are rare in this population. Although no travel health vaccine is cost beneficial, most professionals will offer protection against the frequent risks, while most would find it ridiculous to use all available vaccines in every traveller. It is essentially an arbitrary decision made on the risk level one wishes to recommend protection-but the priorities need to be set correctly.

Nonetheless, these infections are clearly underdiagnosed because methods of diagnosis are still limited and often not available. Another problem is that the bacteria respond to only a few antibiotics, so delayed or wrong antibiotic treatment often leads to a more severe outcome of the disease. In addition to that, the development of antibiotic resistance is a serious threat because alternative antibiotics are missing.

Evaluation of TB vaccines may be facilitated by using reliable animal models that mimic host pathophysiology and natural transmission of the disease as closely as possible. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of two attenuated vaccines, BCG and MTBVAC, after each was given to 17 goats (2 months old) and then exposed for 9 months to goats infected with M. caprae. In general, MTBVAC-vaccinated goats showed higher interferon-gamma release than BCG vaccinated goats in response to bovine protein purified derivative and ESAT-6/CFP-10 antigens and the response was significantly higher than that observed in the control group until challenge. All animals showed lesions consistent with TB at the end of the study. Goats that received either vaccine showed significantly lower scores for pulmonary lymph nodes and total lesions than unvaccinated controls. Both MTBVAC and BCG vaccines proved to be immunogenic and effective in reducing severity of TB pathology caused by M. caprae. Our model system of natural TB transmission may be useful for evaluating and optimizing vaccines.Copyright \textcopyright 2019 The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

M.",,,,,Surveys of the global burden of disease have established that formidable health problems loom as the new millennium approaches. In both industrialized and developing countries lung disease is particularly problematic. Tuberculosis provides a concrete example of the ability of existing interventions such as directly observed therapy (DOT) to save millions of lives in the immediate future and the potential for new knowledge and tools to eventually eliminate the disease. Molecular epidemiology shows the potential of new technology to supplement established approaches in answering questions central to public health. Our knowledge of the complete genomic sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis now has us poised on the brink of a new era. Emerging technologies such as microscopic arrays comprised of thousands of spots of DNA will provide knowledge that will fundamentally alter our approach to disease control. The synergy of a balanced portfolio incorporating a globalized public health commitment and creative basic research will provide us with the infrastructure and tools needed to eliminate tuberculosis before the close of the 21st century.,"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

S.",,,,,"While whole killed, whole protein, or live attenuated vaccines were the standard bearers for protective vaccines in the last century, there are concerns about their safety. New vaccine design techniques are contributing to an emphasis on vaccines developed using the minimum essential subset of T- and B-cell epitopes that comprise the ""immunome."" We have used bioinformatics sequence analysis tools, epitope-mapping tools, microarrays and high-throughput immunology assays to identify the minimal essential vaccine components for smallpox, tularemia, Helicobacter pylori and tuberculosis vaccines. As will be described in this review, this approach has resulted in the development of four immunome-derived epitope-driven vaccines (ID-EDV); three of these proved protective against viral or bacterial challenge. Protective efficacies of 100% (vaccinia), 90% (H. pylori), and 57% (tularemia) were achieved in HLA-transgenic (humanized) mouse models and the p27 knockout mouse (for H. pylori). Such immunome-derived vaccines have a significant advantage over conventional vaccines; the careful selection of the components should diminish undesired side effects such as those observed with whole pathogen and protein subunit vaccines. Here we summarize data showing prototype ID-ED vaccine protection against lethal challenge with vaccinia, tularemia, and H. pylori in a model of infection. The tools that made these successes possible are described and the anticipated clinical development of ID-ED vaccines is discussed. \textcopyright 2009.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,

R.",http://www.nature.com/nri/index.html,,,,"FcgammaRIIB is the only inhibitory Fc receptor. It controls many aspects of immune and inflammatory responses, and variation in the gene encoding this protein has long been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune disease, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). FcgammaRIIB is also involved in the complex regulation of defence against infection. A loss-of-function polymorphism in FcgammaRIIB protects against severe malaria, the investigation of which is beginning to clarify the evolutionary pressures that drive ethnic variation in autoimmunity. Our increased understanding of the function of FcgammaRIIB also has potentially far-reaching therapeutic implications, being involved in the mechanism of action of intravenous immunoglobulin, controlling the efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy and providing a direct therapeutic target. \textcopyright 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It is based on the introduction, via intramuscular injections, particle bombardment, or nasal spray, of a purified DNA plasmid encoding for the polypeptide sequence. The resulting in situ protein synthesis involves biosynthetic processing and post-translational modifications. The effectiveness of DNA vaccines has been demonstrated in many animal models. Cell-mediated immunity (Thl and Th2 responses) and humoral immunity can be obtained. B-cell production of antibodies is generally weaker than induced by traditional vaccines. Various approaches to boost the immune response have been studied, including co-administration of cytokines, co-stimulation with specific genes, and addition of targeting molecules. Research with animal models has shown that DNA vaccines are safe. Deleterious immune responses, such as autoimmunity and development of tolerance in response to persistent expression of a foreign antigen, have not been observed. Phase I and Phase II clinical trials with DNA vaccines have been conducted for HIV, HBV, HVC, HSV, tuberculosis, and malaria. Clinical trials are also in hand for cancer and the treatment of allergies. This new approach of DNA vaccination offers new hope because of their low cost and manufacturing stability at ambient temperature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Included"", ""R2""=>""Included"", ""R3""=>""Included"", ""R4""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: duplicate",,

A case report,2010,,,,,16,10,,"Kontrova, I. and Stourac, P. and Bednarova, J. and Praksova, P. and Hladikova, M. and Benesova, Y.",,,,,"Background: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a demyelinating disorder involving optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. The various associations with disorders as Sjogren's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, viral infections, tuberculosis or vaccination were described. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) is a neurotropic virus causing severe central nervous system infection after reactivation of latent HHV6 in immunocompromised individuals. We report the case of 58-year old woman with NMO and high HHV6 DNA load detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) questioning the potential relationship. Case report: 58-year old woman reported progressive visual loss, concentric reduction of the visual fields since November 2009. Opthalmological examination discovered optical nerve atrophy and visual evoked potential P100 wave prolongation bilaterally. MRI brain scan showed two small T2-hyperintense lesions in frontal lobes and in CSF examination were mild mononuclear pleocytosis (5,6/1mcL mononuclear cells) and normal total protein content 0,32mg/l. Antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies were negative. When admitted to hospital the clinical pattern involved subjective complaints as paresthesias of lower extremities, headache, vertigines and objectively gait ataxia in April 2010. Subsequent CSF examination confirmed neuroinflammation (mixed pleocytosis; 55 mononuclear cells/1mcL, 41 polynuclear cells/1mcL and total protein content 1,2mg/l), 2 IgG oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF. Viral HHV6 DNA load was detected by PCR. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir, improved CSF findings, (mild pleocytosis; 23 mononuclear cells/1mcL, normal total protein content 0,37 mg/l). In spite of this improvement patient developed severe palsy of lower extremities during 2 days. MRI scan of thoracic spinal cord showed demyelinating lesions from C7 to Th5 area. Corticosteriod therapy was unsuccessful. The positivity of antiaquaporin 4 antibodies were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA tests. Clinical pattern, MRI scans and antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica Devic according to current valid criteria. Conclusion(s): We report an association between HHV6 infection and NMO for the first time. As the late primary infection with HHV6 might be associated with multiple sclerosis we cannot exclude such a role of HHV6 virus in other demyelinating diseases including neuromyelitis optica Devic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""R1""=>""Excluded"", ""R2""=>""Excluded"", ""R3""=>""Excluded"", ""R4""=>""Excluded""}",,
